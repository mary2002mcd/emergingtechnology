IT WAS AN OLDFASHIONED SEDATELOOKING HOUSE WITH ABOWWINDOW PROJECTING ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR AND TWO ROWSOF WHITECURTAINED WINDOWS ABOVE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING PRIM ABOUTTHE GARDEN WHICH LAY AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. THIS GARDEN WITH ITSWEALTH OF SWEETSCENTED FLOWERS ITS FRUIT TREES ITS SUNFLOWERS ANDHOLLYHOCKS STANDING OUT IN RICH CONTRAST TO THE MELLOW RED OF THEOLD WALLS WAS A DELIGHTFUL PLACE IN WHICH TO SPEND A WARM SEPTEMBERAFTERNOON.ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN AND BORDERING AT ITS LOWER END THEPORTION WHICH THOUGH NOT DEVOID OF BEAUTY WAS OBVIOUSLY DEVOTEDTO UTILITY WAS A STRIP OF LAWN SHADED BY TREES. HERE ON SUCH ANAFTERNOON HILDA BLAND WAS LYING VERY MUCH AT HER EASE IN A HAMMOCKSUSPENDED BETWEEN TWO STURDY TRUNKS. SHE HAD A BOOK IN HER HAND BUTREADING WAS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE KATE WAS ON THE PATH CLOSE BY CHATTERINGFAST AS SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AND GWEN HER YOUNGER SISTER WASDISPLAYING GREAT ENERGY IN HER ATTEMPTS TO SHAKE OR KNOCK DOWN SOME OFTHE RIPE GREENGAGES THAT WERE VISIBLE AT THE TOP OF THE TALL TREE TOWHICH ONE END OF THE HAMMOCK WAS FASTENED.YOU WONT GET THEM THAT WAY GWEN CRIED KATE AS HER SISTER THREW ARAKE HANDLE AT THE TOP OF THE TREE AND IT CAME RATTLING DOWN THROUGHTHE BRANCHES.YOU ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BREAK MY HEAD SAID HILDA FROM THEHAMMOCK AND YOU SHAKE ME DREADFULLY. YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE RESPECTFOR MY FEELINGS.NONSENSE YOU ARE SO LAZY HILDA IF YOU WERE ANYTHING OF A SISTERYOU WOULD COME AND HELP ME.THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION DEAR SAID HILDA SWEETLY BUT I PREFERREMAINING WHERE I AM. AND SHE THREW HERSELF BACK UPON THE CUSHIONSWITH AN AIR OF INDOLENT GRACE.AT ALL TIMES HILDA HAD RATHER A LANGUID AIR. OF SLENDER FORM BELOWTHE MIDDLE HEIGHT WITH A COLOURLESS COMPLEXION AND FEATURES REGULARAND DELICATELY FORMED SHE HAD A FRAIL APPEARANCE BESIDE HER MOREROBUSTLOOKING SISTERS BUT IN TRUTH HER HEALTH WAS AS GOOD ASTHEIRS. MRS. BLAND USED TO BOAST THAT HER GIRLS WERE NEVER ILL THANKSTO THE CARE WITH WHICH SHE HAD FOLLOWED THE COMMON SENSE RULES FOR THEREARING OF HIS CHILDREN LAID DOWN BY HER DECEASED HUSBAND WHO HADPRACTISED AS A SURGEON AT WOODHAM. THERE WAS A DREAMY ABSENT LOOK INHILDAS LARGE BLUE EYES WHICH SOME PERSONS FOUND INTERESTING ANDOTHERS QUITE THE REVERSE. TO THE UNIMAGINATIVE IT WAS A SLEEPY STUPIDLOOK BUT THE MORE DISCERNING SAW IN IT THE SIGN OF A THOUGHTFULREFLECTIVE NATURE.THERE WAS BUT THE FAINTEST RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HILDA AND KATE WHO WASEIGHTEEN MONTHS OLDER. NO ONE COULD BE LESS DREAMY OR INDOLENT THANKATE OR AS SHE WAS MORE OFTEN CALLED KITTY. WITH BLACK HAIR KEENDARK EYES AND A WARM BROWN COMPLEXION NOW AT THE END OF THE SUMMERDEEPENED TO A GIPSYLIKE HUE SHE LOOKED VERY MUCH ALIVE. HER FORM WASSTURDY THOUGH TRIM HER FEATURES OF A DECIDED CHARACTER THE NOSE OFTHE ROMAN TYPE THE CHIN WELL ROUNDED AND SOMEWHAT PROMINENT THE MOUTHFIRM THOUGH READY ENOUGH TO BREAK INTO SMILES. SHE WAS THE ELDEST OFMRS. BLANDS FAMILY OF FOUR AND HAD PASSED HER TWENTYSECOND BIRTHDAYBUT STRANGERS OFTEN TOOK HER FOR YOUNGER THAN HILDA THERE WAS SO MUCHOF THE CHILD ABOUT KITTY STILL. HILDA WAS THE QUIET ONE OF THE FAMILYFOND OF READING AND DREAMING. KITTY WAS SELDOM STILL. SHE SEEMED MADEFOR A COUNTRY LIFE AND WAS AS HAPPY IN THE RIGOURS OF WINTER AS INTHE SUMMERS PRIME. RIDING ROWING SKATING THERE WERE FEW HEALTHYEXERCISES IN WHICH SHE DID NOT EXCEL. OF THE LIVELIEST TEMPERAMENT SHEWAS A GREAT TALKER AND RATHER SATIRICAL BUT HAPPILY HER NATURE WAS TOOSOUND AND WARM FOR HER SATIRE TO BE TINGED WITH MALICE OR ENVY.I WISH CHARLIE WOULD COME SHE SAID PRESENTLY AS SHE FLITTED TO ANDFRO AMONGST THE FLOWERS IT CHIMED FOUR EVER SO LONG AGO. THERE THEQUARTER IS STRIKING NOW.DID YOU EVER KNOW CHARLIE COME STRAIGHT HOME FROM SCHOOL ASKEDHILDA AS SHE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF HER BROWNING. WHY ARE YOU INSUCH A HURRY TO SEE HIMOH YOU KNOW I AM DYING TO HEAR ABOUT THAT NEW MASTER. THE ARRIVAL OFA STRANGER AT WOODHAM IS SUCH AN EVENT.IS THERE A NEW MASTER ASKED HILDA INDIFFERENTLY.OH HILDA HOW STUPID YOU ARE DONT YOU KNOW THAT MR. FERRIS WASTO LEAVE AT THE END OF LAST TERM AND DID YOU NOT HEAR MISS LORRAINESAY THE OTHER DAY THAT A GENTLEMAN FROM LONDON WAS COMING TO TAKE HISPLACEA B.A. OF CAMBRIDGE SHE SAID HE WASI DID NOT HEAR IT SAID HILDA BUT MISS LORRAINE HAS ALWAYS SO MUCHTO SAY I CANNOT PRETEND TO LISTEN TO EVERY WORD.WELL I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE LISTENED TO THAT RETURNED KATEWHILST GWEN PAUSED FOR A MOMENT IN HER FUTILE EFFORTS TO BRING DOWN THEGREENGAGES AND TURNED TO HEAR WHAT HER SISTERS WERE SAYING.WHY WHAT ABOUT HIM WHAT IS HIS NAME AND WHAT HAS HE TO DO WITH USASKED HILDA ANXIOUS TO GET INFORMATION AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE THATSHE MIGHT RESUME HER READING.I HAVE NOT HEARD HIS NAME AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS ANYTHING TODO WITH US SAID KATE RATHER LAMELY BUT I HOPE FOR CHARLIES SAKETHAT HE IS NICE AND OF COURSE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER HE GOESIN FOR BOATING AND THAT SORT OF THING AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO JOIN OURTENNIS CLUB.OH YOU ARE THINKING OF THE TENNIS SAID HILDA LANGUIDLY BUT THENEXT MOMENT SHE STARTED UP WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF PLEASURE AS SHE SAWWHO WAS COMING DOWN THE PATH FROM THE HOUSE ACCOMPANIED BY MRS. BLAND.THE VISITOR WAS A TALL SLIGHT GIRL WEARING A FRESH COTTON GOWN ANDA WIDE STRAW HAT AS SIMPLY DRESSED AS A GIRL COULD BE YET WITH ACERTAIN BECOMING GRACE PECULIAR TO THE WEARER. YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWNAT FIRST SIGHT WHETHER ALDYTH LORRAINE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED PRETTY BUTYOU WOULD HAVE FELT IN AN INSTANT THAT SHE WAS CHARMING.HER FEATURES WERE NEITHER REGULAR NOR DELICATELY MOULDED. THE CHIN WASTOO LONG THE MOUTH TOO LARGE THE LIPS PERHAPS A TRIFLE TOO FULL FORBEAUTY BUT WHEN THE LIPS PARTED THEY DISPLAYED THE MOST WHITE ANDPERFECT TEETH AND HER SMILE REVEALED THE SWEETNESS OF A FRANK ANDLOVING NATURE. THE LARGEBRIMMED HAT HID THE BROAD FINELYARCHED BROWAND THE DARK BROWN HAIR WHICH RIPPLED BACK FROM IT BUT COULD NOT DIMTHE MERRY HAPPY LIGHT THAT SHONE IN THE GREY EYES. THERE COULD BENO QUESTION AS TO THE BEAUTY OF THOSE EYES LONG IN SHAPE OF A DEEPVIOLETGREY HUE AND SHADED BY LONG DARK LASHES. BUT WHILST WE MAYATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE FEATURES WHAT WORDS CAN GIVE THE CHARM OF A SWEETGIRLS FACE ALDYTHS HAD A CHARM WHICH WON MANY HEARTS. BUT PERHAPSTHE CHARM WAS RATHER IN HERSELF THAN IN HER FACE. THAT WAS WINSOMEBECAUSE HER HEART WAS TENDER AND TRUE AND SYMPATHETIC FULL OF KINDFEELINGS TOWARDS EVERY ONE SHE MET.TO THINK OF MY FINDING YOU ALL AT HOME EXCLAIMED ALDYTH. I FELTSURE YOU WOULD BE AT TENNIS THIS LOVELY AFTERNOON AND THAT I SHOULDHAVE A QUIET CHAT WITH MRS. BLAND.I AM SORRY FOR YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT SAID KITTY BUT THERE HAS BEENNOTHING TO HINDER YOUR HAVING A QUIET TALK WITH MOTHER. THE FACT ISCLARA DAWTREY HAS A PARTY OF HER FRIENDS ON THE GROUND THIS AFTERNOON.KITTYS LIP CURLED AS SHE SPOKE.ALDYTHS QUICK LITTLE NOD EXPRESSED PERFECT COMPREHENSION.WHAT A PITY THAT GIRL IS SO LOUD IN HER MANNERS SHE REMARKED. IFEEL SOMETIMES AS IF I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE HER A LITTLE HINT BUT ISUPPOSE IT WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AUNT SAYS THAT IF SHE ONLYKNEW THE THINGS THAT ARE SAID OF HER EVEN BY THE GENTLEMEN SHE COUNTSHER ADMIRERS SHE WOULD ALTER HER WAYS.AS SHE SPOKE ALDYTH WAS LIFTING A CHAIR OUT OF THE SUMMERHOUSE AT THEEND OF THE LAWN FOR MRS. BLAND.GWEN CRIED KITTY WHO HAD HER HANDS TOO FULL OF FLOWERS TO RENDERASSISTANCE DO YOU SEE WHAT ALDYTH IS DOING HOW RUDE YOU ARE IT ISTIME YOU WENT BACK TO SCHOOL.NEVER MIND GWEN SAID ALDYTH LAUGHING AS THE GIRL RUSHED UP TOOLATE TO BE OF USE IT WONT KILL ME TO LIFT A CHAIR. AND IT IS CRUELOF KITTY TO REMIND YOU THAT MONDAY IS SO NEAR. CHARLIE HAS GONE BACK TOSCHOOL TODAY HAS HE NOTOH THAT IS NOTHING I WISH I ONLY WENT TO A DAYSCHOOL SAID GWENA BIG GIRL OF FIFTEEN BUT IS NOT KITTY CURIOUS SHE IS DYING TOQUESTION CHARLIE ABOUT THE NEW MASTER. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIMSOME ONE ELSE IS CURIOUS I THINK SAID ALDYTH MERRILY. ALL I KNOWOF HIM IS THAT HE IS NAMED JOHN GLYNNE AND AUNT LUCY IS TRYING TOPERSUADE HERSELF THAT HE IS ONE OF THE GLYNNES OF NORFOLK AND THAT SHEWENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIS MOTHER. AH HERE IS CHARLIE NOW WE SHALL HEAR.A BOY OF TWELVE SATCHEL IN HAND CAME BOUNDING DOWN THE GARDEN. BUTBOYLIKE CHARLIE WOULD YIELD BUT MEAGRE REPLIES TO THE QUESTIONS WITHWHICH THE GIRLS PLIED HIM.YES HE HAD SEEN MR. GLYNNE OF COURSE. HE HAD TAKEN THEIR CLASS FORLATIN AND THEY WERE TO READ SHAKESPEARE WITH HIM ON FRIDAY AFTERNOONS.HE DID NOT KNOW THAT MR. GLYNNE WAS ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MASTERSHE DID NOT LIKE HIM SO WELL AS MR. FERRIS. HE HAD GIVEN THEM A LOT TOPREPARE AND HE HAD COME DOWN LIKE A LOAD OF BRICKS ON ONE BOY WHOMHE HAD CAUGHT WITH A BOOK OPEN BENEATH HIS DESK. HE SAID IT WAS AS BADAS STEALING TO TAKE THE CREDIT OF KNOWING A LESSON WHICH HAD NOT BEENSTUDIED AND THAT HE HAD HOPED HE WAS GOING TO TEACH MANLY BOYS ANDNOT SNEAKS.HE IS QUITE RIGHT SAID MRS. BLAND WARMLY. I HATE TO HEAR OF BOYSDOING SUCH DECEITFUL THINGS. CHARLIE IT WOULD GRIEVE ME BEYOND WORDSTO EXPRESS IF I THOUGHT YOU COULD ACT IN SUCH A WAY. BUT I AM NOTAFRAID. I BELIEVE THAT MY BOY WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE AND STRAIGHTFORWARDIN HIS CONDUCT.ALL RIGHT MOTHER SAID CHARLIE HASTILY. BUT PLEASE I WANTTHAT HALFCROWN YOU PROMISED ME. IM OFF TO STUBBS NOW ABOUT THOSERABBITS. AND NO MORE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NEW MASTER WAS TO BEDRAWN FROM HIM.TIRESOME YOUNG MONKEY CRIED KATE AS CHARLIE RAN OFF WITH HISHALFCROWN. ALDYTH YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW PROVOKING A YOUNG BROTHER CANBE. YOU HAVE NO BROTHERS OR SISTERS TO TROUBLE YOU.I HAVE A BROTHER AND SISTERS SAID ALDYTH THOUGH THEY CANNOTCERTAINLY BE SAID TO TROUBLE ME.TO BE SURE I ALWAYS FORGET THOSE RELATIVES OF YOURS ON THE OTHER SIDEOF THE WORLD SAID KATE CARELESSLY. I MUST SAY I COULD NOT FEEL MUCHAFFECTION FOR HALFBROTHERS AND SISTERS WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN.BUT I HOPE TO SEE THEM SOME DAY SAID ALDYTH COLOURING AS SHE SPOKEAND I WRITE TO THEM AND THEY WRITE TO ME SOMETIMES. I SHOULD BE SORRYTO FEEL AS IF I DID NOT BELONG TO THEM. BUT I MUST BE GOING. I ONLYLOOKED IN TO ASK MRS. BLAND IF I HAD BOUGHT THE RIGHT KIND OF WOOL THATMOTHER WANTS ME TO SEND HER.OH ALDYTH DONT GO YET EXCLAIMED HILDA SPRINGING UP IN THEHAMMOCK AND WELLNIGH OVERBALANCING HERSELF. DO TRY THE HAMMOCKITS DELICIOUS THIS AFTERNOON. A THOUSAND APOLOGIES FOR NOT ASKING YOUBEFORE.NOT NOW THANK YOU HILDA SAID ALDYTH I HAVE MY LETTER TO FINISHFOR THE MAIL.THOUGH ALDYTH WAS ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH ALL THE BLAND FAMILYHILDA WAS ESPECIALLY HER FRIEND. THE TWO GIRLS WALKED ARMINARM TO THEGARDEN DOOR AND AFTER A PROLONGED GOODBYE THERE HILDA CAME BACK TOHER MOTHER AND SISTERS.KITTY SHE SAID YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT ABOUT ALDYTHSRELATIVES. I AM SURE YOU HURT HER FOR SHE THINKS SO MUCH OF THEM ALL.SHE IS ALWAYS WRITING TO THEM AND SHE NEVER FORGETS ONE OF THEIRBIRTHDAYS THOUGH THEY SOMETIMES FORGET HERS.I AM VERY SORRY SAID KITTY BUT REALLY IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THATSHE CAN CARE AS MUCH FOR HER BROTHER AND SISTERS AS IF THEY HAD BEENBROUGHT UP TOGETHER.SHE MAY NOT CARE IN THE SAME WAY BUT SHE CERTAINLY LOVES THEM AND ASFOR HER MOTHER IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALDYTH SIMPLY WORSHIPS THE MOTHERWHOM SHE HAS NEVER SEEN.SHE MUST HAVE SEEN HER SAID KATE.OF COURSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE SO ABSURDLY LITERAL KATE. ALDYTHWAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HER MOTHER WENT TO AUSTRALIA. SHE CANNOTREMEMBER HER.IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME THAT MISS LORRAINE IS MORE TRULY ALDYTHSMOTHER SAID MRS. BLAND. SHE HAS HAD THE CARE OF HER EVER SINCESHE WAS A FEW MONTHS OLD FOR SHORTLY AFTER ALDYTH WAS BORN CAPTAINLORRAINES HEALTH BEGAN TO FAIL AND THEN MRS. LORRAINE TRAVELLED ABOUTWITH HIM AND THE BABY WAS LEFT WITH HER AUNT. I AM SURE MISS LORRAINEFEELS THAT ALDYTH IS HER CHILD AND I BELIEVE SHE PROVIDES FOR HERALMOST ENTIRELY.YES BUT ALDYTH DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THAT SAID HILDA. SHE IS FOND OFHER AUNT AND VERY GRATEFUL TO HER BUT SHE LOVES HER MOTHER BEST. SHEIS ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD TO HER MOTHERS COMING TO ENGLAND. I WONDERIF SHE EVER WILL COMEPOOR ALDYTH SAID MRS. BLAND WITH A SIGH.WHY DO YOU ALWAYS SAY POOR ALDYTH WHEN WE SPEAK OF ALDYTHS MOTHERASKED HILDA QUICKLY.DO I ALWAYS SAY IT REPLIED MRS. BLAND.YES YOU DO MOTHER AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY. I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSEYOU THINK THAT ALDYTHS MOTHER LOVES HER ELDEST CHILD LESS THAN HERELDEST CHILD LOVES HER. IS THAT ITWELL PERHAPS MRS. BLAND ADMITTED. I MUST CONFESS I FIND IT HARDTO UNDERSTAND HOW A MOTHER COULD LEAVE SUCH A TINY CHILD BEHIND HER INENGLAND AND LET HER GROW UP TO WOMANHOOD WITHOUT MAKING AN EFFORT TOSEE HER. I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THE OTHER CHILDREN BORN TO HER INMELBOURNE HAVE TAKEN ALDYTHS PLACE IN HER HEART AND THAT ABSORBEDIN HER HOME LIFE SHE THINKS BUT LITTLE OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ANDREGARDS HER RATHER AS MISS LORRAINES ADOPTED CHILD THAN AS HER OWN.BUT SHE WANTS TO COME HOME AND HER COMING HAS OFTEN BEEN TALKED OFSAID HILDA. SHE TELLS ALDYTH IN HER LETTERS HOW SHE LONGS TO SEE HER.I DARE SAY SAID MRS. BLAND DRILY BUT A MOTHERS PASSIONATEYEARNING TO SEE HER CHILD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THEM TO MEETBEFORE NOW I THINK.YOU KNEW ALDYTHS MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL DID YOU NOT ASKEDKATE. IS ALDYTH LIKE HERYES AND NO SAID MRS. BLAND ALDYTHS MOTHER WAS A LOVELY GIRLAND HAD MOST FASCINATING WAYS. ALDYTH IS MORE OF A LORRAINE AND YETSHE OFTEN REMINDS ME OF HER MOTHER. BUT THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCEIHARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN ITBUT THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEENTHEM. ALDYTH SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED HER FATHERS FRANK LOVING NATURETOGETHER WITH HER MOTHERS BRIGHTNESS.HAD NOT MRS. LORRAINE A LOVING NATURE HILDA ASKED.WELL NOT AS A GIRL. SHE WAS THE BELLE OF THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD ANDHAD MANY ADMIRERS AND THAT SORT OF THING MAKES SAME GIRLS CALLOUS.THEN HER PARENTS WERE POOR AND DESIGNING AND THEY HURRIED HER INTO AMARRIAGE WITH CAPTAIN LORRAINE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS TO BE HISUNCLES HEIR. I DO NOT BELIEVE SHE LOVED HIM AND SHE WAS TOO YOUNGTO HAVE AN IDEA OF THE SERIOUS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF MARRIEDLIFE. YOU KNOW I THINK NO GIRL SHOULD BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE IS ONE ANDTWENTY.AND THE MARRIAGE PROVED AN UNHAPPY ONE I SUPPOSE SAID KATE.I FEAR SO SAID MRS. BLAND. STEPHEN LORRAINE STRONGLY DISAPPROVEDOF IT AND WHEN HIS NEPHEW MARRIED IN SPITE OF HIS DISAPPROVAL HEWOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HIM. THE CAPTAIN WAS HARASSED WITHMONEY DIFFICULTIES AND AS HIS HEALTH FAILED HE GREW MORBID ANDDEPRESSED. I HEARD MRS. LORRAINE SAY ONCE THAT LIVING WITH HIM WAS LIKEBEING CONTINUALLY WITH A WET BLANKET. SHE WAS EASILY CONSOLED AFTERHIS DEATH FOR WITHIN A YEAR SHE MARRIED MR. STANTON AND SAILED FORAUSTRALIA.POOR ALDYTH SIGHED HILDA. IT SEEMS HARD THAT HER MOTHER SHOULDDESERT HER LIKE THAT. MISS LORRAINE IS VERY KIND BUT SHE IS SO FUSSYAND TALKATIVE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LIVE WITH HER.I WONDER IF ALDYTH WILL EVER JOIN HER FAMILY SAID KITTY AND HOWSHE WILL LIKE THEM IF SHE DOESI ALMOST HOPE THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN SAID MRS. BLAND FOR I FANCY ITWOULD MEAN DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ALDYTH.SHE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE SUCH A DEAR LITTLE MOTHER ASYOU CRIED GWEN SUDDENLY BESTOWING A WARM HUG ON HER MOTHER.MRS. BLAND LAUGHED AT GWENS VEHEMENCE BUT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES ASSHE KISSED GWEN.THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND FOLLOWED A YEAR LATER BY THAT OF HER ELDESTBOY THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN HILDA HAD INTENSIFIED THE ANXIETY THATALMOST INVARIABLY ATTENDS A MOTHERS LOVE BUT MRS. BLAND WAS A WISEWOMAN AND KEPT MOST OF HER FEARS TO HERSELF TAKING CARE NOT TO WORRYHER CHILDREN. THUS IT WAS THAT HER GIRLS GREW UP WITH THE FEELING THATTHEIR MOTHER WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND AND THERE WAS NO CONSTRAINT BETWEENTHEM THOUGH HILDA AT TIMES EVINCED A CERTAIN RESERVE OF CHARACTERWHICH CAUSED HER MOTHER SOME UNEASINESS.MRS. BLANDS HEART WAS SO ESSENTIALLY THAT OF A MOTHER THAT ITSSYMPATHIES COULD NOT BE BOUNDED BY HER OWN HOME CIRCLE. THE FRIENDSOF HER GIRLS WERE HER FRIENDS ALSO AND RESPONDED GRATEFULLY TO THEKINDNESS SHE SHOWED THEM. AS FOR ALDYTH LORRAINE SHE WAS WELLNIGH ASDEAR TO MRS. BLAND AS ONE OF HER OWN CHILDREN. SHE HAD GROWN UP WITHKATE AND HILDA. THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED ONLY DURING THEIR SCHOOL TERMSALDYTH HAVING BEEN SENT TO A MORE EXPENSIVE SCHOOL THAN MRS. BLANDCOULD AFFORD FOR HER DAUGHTERS. ALDYTH OFTEN SAID THAT MRS. BLAND WASTHE MOST MOTHERLY WOMAN SHE KNEW AND UNCONSCIOUSLY THE GIRLS THOUGHTSOF HER ABSENT MOTHER AND HER DREAMS OF WHAT THEIR MEETING WOULD BEWERE LARGELY COLOURED BY WHAT SHE SAW OF THE LOVE AND CONFIDENCEEXISTING BETWEEN MRS. BLAND AND HER DAUGHTERS.CHAPTER II.A NOVEL INTRODUCTION.THE HOUSE IN WHICH ALDYTH LORRAINE LIVED WITH HER AUNT WAS SCARCELYTEN MINUTES WALK FROM MRS. BLANDS. THE HIGH STREET TOOK A TURN JUSTABOVE THE BLANDS DOOR AND WINDING ROUND TO THE LEFT ENDED AT AN OPENSPACE WHERE THREE ROADS MET. TO THE LEFT DIVERGED THE TOLLESHUNT ANDLONGBRIDGE ROADS. THE ROAD WHICH WAS ALMOST A CONTINUATION OF THE HIGHSTREET WAS KNOWN AS THE LONDON ROAD AND WAS THE MORE FASHIONABLE PARTOF WOODHAM. HERE WERE THE NEWEST AND SMARTEST VILLAS THAT THE LITTLETOWN COULD BOAST BUT HERE AND THERE AMONGST THEM STOOD A HOUSE WITH AHISTORY A HISTORY WHICH WENT BACK THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS SO THATONE MIGHT IMAGINE THE OLD DWELLING TO LOOK WITH CONTEMPT ON ITS MODERNUPSTART NEIGHBOURS.MISS LORRAINES HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE OLD ONES AND WAS KNOWN AS MYRTLECOTTAGE. IT WAS NOT VERY CONVENIENT BUT IT WAS PICTURESQUE HAVINGA THATCHED ROOF AND WALLS TAPESTRIED WITH IVY. IT STOOD IN A PRETTYGARDEN SHELTERED BY A THICK HAWTHORN HEDGE AND AS IT WAS THE LASTOF THE HOUSES AND THE ROAD DIPPED SHARPLY ON THE OTHER SIDE IT HADA FINE VIEW OF A WIDE EXPANSE OF FLAT COUNTRY GREEN MEADOWS ANDHEDGEROWS CORNFIELDS AND COPSES MELTING AWAY INTO THE EXQUISITE BLUEOF DISTANCE.LEAVING THE BLANDS ALDYTH WALKED QUICKLY TO THE COTTAGE BUT HERHASTE DID NOT PREVENT HER PAUSING FOR A MOMENT WITH HER HAND ON THEGATE TO GAZE AT THE FARREACHING PROSPECT BATHED IN THE MELLOW LIGHTOF THE LOVELY SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON. THERE WAS SOMETHING TO ALDYTH VERYHEARTSATISFYING IN THAT BROAD FAIR LANDSCAPE AND SHE NEVER WEARIEDOF LOOKING AT IT.BUT AS SHE GAZED NOW SHE BECAME AWARE THAT A YOUNG MAN WAS SEATED ONTHE LOW BANK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD. FOR A MOMENT SHE IMAGINEDTHAT HE WAS MERELY SITTING THERE TO ENJOY THE PROSPECT BUT ANOTHERGLANCE SHOWED HER THAT HE WAS VERY PALE AND THERE WAS BLOOD ON THEHANDKERCHIEF HE WAS PRESSING TO HIS TEMPLE HIS CAP LAY IN THE DUSTAND LEANING AGAINST THE HEDGE A FEW PACES DOWN THE BILL WAS ABICYCLE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE COME TO GRIEF. INSTANTLY ALDYTH CROSSEDTHE ROAD SAYING KINDLYI FEAR YOU HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT. ARE YOU MUCH HURTOH IT IS NOTHING THANK YOU SAID THE STRANGER IN REFINEDCOURTEOUS TONES I HAVE HAD AN AWKWARD FALL AND CUT MY FOREHEAD BUTTHE PAIN IS NOTHING IF ONLY IT WOULD STOP BLEEDING.WONT YOU COME IN AND LET MY AUNT SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO FOR YOU SAIDALDYTH. THIS IS HER HOUSE AND SHE IS RATHER CLEVER AT DRESSINGWOUNDS.YOU ARE VERY KIND SAID THE YOUNG MAN MEETING ALDYTHS GLANCE WITH APAIR OF CLEAR BLUE EYES THAT HAD A VERY PENETRATIVE GAZE BUT I THINKTHERE IS NO NEED TO TROUBLE YOUR AUNT I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT IN A FEWMINUTES.BUT A FRESH SPURT OF BLOOD FROM THE WOUND MADE HIM PRESS THEHANDKERCHIEF CLOSER TO HIS FACE AND THE COLOUR WHICH HAD RETURNED TOIT DIED AWAY.INDEED YOU HAD BETTER COME IN SAID ALDYTH EARNESTLY. YOU KNOW YOUREALLY CANNOT GO HOME LIKE THAT. PEOPLE WOULD STARE AT YOU SO.THE LAST WORDS HAD THEIR EFFECT. THE YOUNG MANS FACE BROKE INTO AMERRY SMILE.THEY WOULD INDEED HE SAID. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT. AND THE BOYSWHAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM THANK YOU I WILL AVAIL MYSELF OF YOURKINDNESS.THAT IS RIGHT SAID ALDYTH MAKING A MOVEMENT AS THOUGH SHE WOULDPICK UP HIS CAP BUT HE SAW HER INTENTION AND WAS BEFORE HER THOUGHSTOOPING BROUGHT A RETURN OF THE GIDDINESS WHICH HE HAD AT FIRSTEXPERIENCED. SHE HAD TO HELP HIM BRING HIS BICYCLE WITHIN THE GARDENTHEN SHE HURRIED ON TO THE HOUSE THE STRANGER FOLLOWING WITH A SLOWAND SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN STEP.HAPPILY MISS LORRAINE WAS AT HOME. SHE WAS SEATED AT HER DESK IN THELITTLE DRAWING ROOM WHICH OPENED AT ONE SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR. A GREATTALKER MISS LORRAINE WAS NOT LESS GREAT AS A CORRESPONDENT. WHEN NOTPAYING CALLS OR ENTERTAINING VISITORS SHE WAS GENERALLY TO BE FOUNDWRITING LETTERS.AUNT LUCY HERE IS A GENTLEMAN I MET AT THE GATE. HE HAS HAD ANACCIDENT HE FELL FROM HIS BICYCLE. DO COME AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO FORHIM.MY DEAR AN ACCIDENT CRIED MISS LORRAINE SPRINGING UP WITH ALACRITY.SHE CAME BUSTLING INTO THE HALL A COMELY LITTLE WOMAN WHOSE AGE ITWOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE FOR HER BLACK HAIR WAS SCARCETOUCHED WITH GREY HER EYES BRIGHT SHE MOVED AND SPOKE BRISKLY ANDWAS ALWAYS DRESSED IN A DAINTY BECOMING STYLE. OF GREAT ENERGY SHELOVED TO BE OF USE IN ANY WAY AND AS ALDYTH KNEW WELL WAS DELIGHTEDBY THIS UNEXPECTED CALL TO RENDER SURGICAL AID.ALDYTH HAD NOT GIVEN A THOUGHT TO THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE STRANGERBUT MISS LORRAINE RECOGNIZED THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN POINTED OUTTO HER THAT MORNING AS THE NEW MASTER AT THE WOODHAM GRAMMAR SCHOOL.SHE WELCOMED HIM HEARTILY TOOK HIM IN HAND AT ONCE IN HER QUICKENERGETIC FASHION AND HAD SOON SPONGED THE WOUND AND DRESSED IT NOTUNSKILFULLY WITH LINT AND PLASTER.NOW MR. GLYNNE YOU MUST STAY AND TAKE TEA WITH ME AND ALDYTH. YESINDEED YOU MUST REST AFTER SUCH A SHOCK AND THE QUIETER YOU KEEP THESOONER THE WOUND WILL HEAL.YOU ARE VERY KIND SAID JOHN GLYNNE FEELING THE ATTRACTION OF THEBRIGHT LITTLE HOME IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF AND INCLINED TO ACCEPTTHE INVITATION BUT YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ME SINCE YOU KNOW MYNAME WHILST I HAVE YET TO LEARN TO WHOM I AM INDEBTED FOR SUCH KINDSERVICES.OH NO ONE CAN BE LONG A STRANGER AT WOODHAM SAID MISS LORRAINE WEHAVE A CURIOUS FACULTYHAVE WE NOT ALDYTHOF FINDING OUT THE HISTORYOF EVERYBODY AND IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE MORE THAN ONE DAY MR. GLYNNEYOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT I AM MISS LORRAINE AND THIS IS MY NIECEALDYTH. I AM PRETTY WELLKNOWN HAVING LIVED AT WOODHAM ALL MY LIFE.AND THERE ARE FEW PERSONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO HAVE NOT HEARD OF MYFATHER DR. LORRAINE WHO PRACTISED AS A PHYSICIAN HERE FOR MANY YEARS.PEOPLE WOULD COME MILES TO CONSULT HIM.AND DID HE LEAVE NO SON TO SUCCEED TO HIS PRACTICE ASKED MR. GLYNNE.NO SAID MISS LORRAINE A SHADOW FALLING ON HER FACE I HAD BUT ONEBROTHER ALDYTHS FATHER AND HE CHOSE THE ARMY AS HIS PROFESSION.CHARLIE BLAND WAS MY FATHERS PARTNER AND HE SUCCEEDED HIM BUT HEDIED POOR FELLOW A FEW YEARS LATER. HIS WIDOW AND FAMILY LIVE IN THATLARGE HOUSE WITH BOWWINDOWS AT THE TOP OF THE HIGH STREET.BUT MR.

IS THEREA BOY AT THE SCHOOL BELONGING TO THE FAMILYYES CHARLIE BLAND GOES TO THE SCHOOL SAID ALDYTH. HE IS A NICEBOY. I KNOW HIM WELL FOR THE BLANDS ARE GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE.MISS LORRAINE WAS MOVING TO AND FRO BETWEEN DINING ROOM AND DRAWINGROOM ON HOSPITABLE THOUGHTS INTENT. NOTHING COULD PLEASE HER BETTERTHAN THAT SHE SHOULD BE THE FIRST LADY AT WOODHAM TO MAKE THEACQUAINTANCE OF THE NEW MASTER. AS FOR JOHN GLYNNE HE WAS BEGINNING TOREGARD HIS ACCIDENT AS A FORTUNATE OCCURRENCE SINCE IT HAD INTRODUCEDHIM TO THIS BRIGHT GOODNATURED WOMAN AND HER CHARMING NIECE.

THERE ARE MANY HILLS ABOUT WOODHAMARE THERE NOT ALDYTHTHEY SEEM CONSIDERABLE HILLS TO US REPLIED ALDYTH. BUT I DARE SAYPEOPLE COMING FROM HILLY DISTRICTS WOULD NOT THINK MUCH OF THEM. FROMWHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY DO YOU COME MR. GLYNNEI WAS BROUGHT UP IN NORFOLK HE SAID BUT WE HAVE LIVED IN LONDONNOW FOR MANY YEARS.NORFOLK EXCLAIMED MISS LORRAINE EAGERLY.

HOW STRANGEWE WERE GIRLS AT SCHOOL TOGETHER SHE WAS MY GREAT FRIEND IN THOSEDAYS SAID MISS LORRAINE BUT SHE WENT ABROAD TO PERFECT HERSELFIN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGES AND GRADUALLY OUR CORRESPONDENCE DROPPED.I HEARD SOME YEARS LATER THAT SHE HAD MARRIED A CLERGYMAN AND WASLIVING NEAR YARMOUTH THEN AFTER A WHILE I HEARD THAT HER HUSBAND WASDEAD. I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO SEE HER AGAIN. AND NOW I SEE HER SON. HOWSTRANGE IT SEEMSMY MOTHER WILL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT I HAVE MET WITH AN OLD FRIENDOF HERS SAID JOHN GLYNNE.

MY MOTHER WAS LEFT WITH VERY LIMITED MEANS AND SHE HAS HADA STRUGGLE TO BRING US UP. BUT THINGS ARE EASIER FOR HER NOW I AMTHANKFUL TO SAY.YOU HAVE HELPED TO MAKE THEM EASIER WAS ALDYTHS QUICK THOUGHT ASSHE SAW THE EXPRESSION HIS FACE WORE WHEN HE SPOKE OF HIS MOTHER.IT WAS A GOOD FACE AND MORE AND MORE IT WON ON HER DESPITE THE UGLYBANDAGE WHICH CONCEALED THE SQUARE COMPACT FOREHEAD BETOKENING A HIGHORDER OF INTELLECT. THE FEATURES WERE NOT HANDSOME BUT THEY WERESTRONG THE BLUE EYES HAD THE KINDEST FRANKEST LOOK IN THEM AND THECURVES OF THE MOUTH AND THE PECULIARLY SWEET SMILE TOLD OF A WARM TRUEHEART.HE IS A GOOD SON WAS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH ALDYTH ARRIVEDINTUITIVELY AND THE THOUGHT DEEPENED THE FRIENDLY REGARD IN WHICH SHEALREADY HELD HIM. HIS AGE SHE JUDGED TO BE ABOUT SEVENANDTWENTY.SO YOU HAVE COME TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL SAID MISS LORRAINE AFTER AMOMENTS REFLECTION. ARE YOU FOND OF TEACHINGYES HE SAID BUT ALDYTH SAW THAT HIS FACE CLOUDED A LITTLE. IBELIEVE I LIKE TEACHING BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT I AM VERY FOND OF THEDRUDGERY OF TEACHING SMALL BOYS. I HAD HOPED TO OBTAIN A DIFFERENT KINDOF APPOINTMENT BUT IT FELL TO ANOTHER AND BEING OFFERED THIS POST ATTHE WOODHAM SCHOOL I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO TAKE IT. MY MOTHER DOES NOTLIKE IT FOR ME BUT I TELL HER THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE VERY SALUTARY. IHAVE LATELY BEEN ATTEMPTING UNIVERSITY EXTENSION LECTURES.HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED ALDYTH GREATLY INTERESTED. OH I HAVE HEARD OFTHEMLECTURES ON LITERATURE AND SCIENCE WITH CLASSES AFTERWARDS FORTHOSE WHO ARE EARNEST STUDENTS. HOW I WISH WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING OFTHE KIND HEREWHY SHOULD YOU NOT HE ASKED. SURELY THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE ATWOODHAM TO FORM A CENTRE.THERE ARE PEOPLE ENOUGH NO DOUBT SAID ALDYTH BUT I FEAR THEY ARENOT SUFFICIENTLY INTELLECTUAL. THEY WOULD NOT CARE TO IMPROVE THEIRMINDS. ON WHAT SUBJECTS DO YOU LECTURE MR. GLYNNELITERATURE IS MY SUBJECT HE SAID. I HAVE LECTURED CHIEFLY ONSHAKESPEARE AND THE POETS.ON SHAKESPEARE HOW DELIGHTFUL EXCLAIMED ALDYTH. I WOULD GIVEANYTHING TO STUDY SHAKESPEARE WITH ONE WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD HIM. IALWAYS FEEL MY OWN NARROWNESS AND IGNORANCE WHEN I COME TO SHAKESPEARE.AND WORDSWORTH I LONG TO READ HIM INTELLIGENTLY. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVEDHIS POETRY THOUGH I HARDLY KNOW WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I SHOULD LIKETO BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE IT RIGHTLY. SOME OF HIS POEMS SEEM TO ME SOMUCH GRANDER THAN OTHERS.THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HIS WORK WAS UNEQUAL AND IT IS CURIOUS HOWUNABLE HE WAS TO DISCERN HIS OWN HIGHEST WORK SAID MR. GLYNNE BUTI AM GLAD YOU LOVE WORDSWORTH MISS LORRAINE FOR I HAVE A GREATENTHUSIASM FOR HIM AND IT IS BUT RARELY I MEET ANY ONE WHO SHARES THEFEELING. IT IS A BOND OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN US.HE LOOKED AT HER WITH FRANK BOYISH PLEASURE IN HIS CLEAR BRIGHT EYES.ALDYTH MET HIS GAZE UNSHRINKINGLY BUT SHE TOO WAS CONSCIOUS OF ATHRILL OF PLEASURE. TO ONE WHOSE LIFE IS BOUNDED BY A NARROW CIRCLE ITIS A GREAT GAIN TO FIND A FRIEND WHO SHARES ONES INTELLECTUAL TASTESAND PREDILECTIONS.WE MUST HAVE SOME LECTURES THIS WINTER I SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDNOT SAID MISS LORRAINE IN HER QUICK DECISIVE WAY. IT WOULD BE ACAPITAL THING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. TELL ME HOW TO SET ABOUT IT MR.GLYNNE AND I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.AUNTIE CRIED ALDYTH IN A TONE OF DELIGHT.YOU MUST GET TOGETHER A COMMITTEE OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MR.GLYNNE. APPOINT A LOCAL SECRETARY HIRE A ROOM FOR THE LECTURESCHOOSE YOUR SUBJECT AND APPLY TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SOCIETY FORA LECTURER ARRANGE THE TERMS FOR THE COURSE OF LECTURES MAKING THEMAS LOW AS YOU CAN WITHOUT INCURRING DEBT AND ISSUE BILL AND CIRCULARSANNOUNCING THE LECTURES.ALL THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT SAID MISS LORRAINE. I WILL SPEAK TO SOMEOF MY FRIENDS ON THE SUBJECT TOMORROW. BUT YOU MUST GIVE THE LECTURESMR. GLYNNE. I WILL ONLY MOVE IN THE MATTER ON THAT CONDITION.BUT MR. GLYNNE WOULD MAKE NO PROMISE THOUGH HE APPEARED NOT UNWILLINGTO FILL THE POST OF LECTURER IF HE FOUND THAT HIS OTHER ENGAGEMENTSWOULD PERMIT HIM TO DO SO. HE SAT TALKING TO MISS LORRAINE AND HERNIECE TILL LONG AFTER IT GREW DUSK AND WHEN AT LAST HE WALKED AWAY TOHIS LODGINGS THERE WAS NO FEAR OF ANY ONES SEEING THE PATCH UPON HISTEMPLE.THE DAYS INCIDENT HAD GIVEN A BRIGHTER COLOUR TO THE PROSPECT OF HISSOJOURN AT WOODHAM. ALREADY HE HAD MADE FRIENDS IN THE LITTLE TOWN ANDHE FELT SURE THAT ITS INHABITANTS WERE SIMPLEHEARTED GOODNATUREDPEOPLE ACQUAINTANCE WITH WHOM COULD YIELD ONLY PLEASURE.AS FOR ALDYTH AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE AWOKE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HADQUITE FORGOTTEN THE LONG LETTER TO HER MOTHER WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEENFINISHED THAT EVENING.CHAPTER III.GUY LORRAINE.ALDYTH ROSE EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THAT HER LETTER MIGHT BE FINISHEDAND POSTED ERE THE MORNING MAIL WENT OUT. THE CLOCK HAD NOT LONGSTRUCK SEVEN WHEN SHE THREW WIDE HER CASEMENT AND LET IN THE FRESHDELICIOUS AIR. BIRDS WERE CHIRPING BENEATH THE EAVES AND FLUTTERING TOAND FRO THE DEWY GRASS WAS SPARKLING IN THE SUN AND THE GARDEN LOOKEDMOST TEMPTING BUT ALDYTH TURNED RESOLUTELY FROM THE WINDOW AND SEATEDHERSELF AT HER WRITINGTABLE.ONE MAY OFTEN GAIN INSIGHT INTO A GIRLS CHARACTER BY A GLANCE ROUNDHER ROOM. ALDYTHS ROOM IN WHICH SHE TOOK SOME PRIDE AS GIRLS DOIN A PLACE THAT IS THEIR VERY OWN REVEALED THAT SHE HAD A REFINEDAND CULTURED MIND. THERE WAS NOTHING LUXURIOUS IN ITS ARRANGEMENTSBUT IT WAS A PRETTY ROOM DESPITE THE DISADVANTAGE THAT OWING TO THEOLDFASHIONED CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE THE CEILING SLOPED SHARPLY ONONE SIDE. FLOWERS STOOD IN GLASSES ON THE DRESSINGTABLE AND BEES WEREBUZZING OVER THE MIGNONETTE PLANTED IN A BOX ON THE WINDOW SILL.WATERCOLOUR DRAWINGS ADORNED THE WALLS SOME OF THEM PAINTED BYALDYTH AND SOME THE GIFTS OF SCHOOL FRIENDS AND HERE AND THERE WEREPHOTOGRAPHS OF ALDYTHS FAVOURITE HEROESCARLYLE RUSKIN AND CHARLESKINGSLEY TENNYSON AND BROWNING. THE LITTLE WOODEN BOOKCASE HELD ASELECTION OF BOOKS ANY GIRL MIGHT BE PROUD TO POSSESS. THERE WEREDAINTILYBOUND EDITIONS OF ALL OUR GREATEST POETS WITH SOME OF OURNOBLEST WORKS OF FICTION AND STANDARD WORKS OF PROSE TOO SHOWINGTHAT ALDYTH DID NOT READ FOR MERE ENTERTAINMENT THOUGH IN READING SHEFOUND ONE OF THE HIGHEST PLEASURES OF HER LIFE. FOR ALDYTH LOVED BOOKSSHE STINTED HERSELF OF MANY OF THE PRETTY THINGS GIRLS LOVE THAT SHEMIGHT SPEND HER POCKET MONEY ON BOOKS AND AT ANY TIME A BOOKSHOP HADMORE ATTRACTION FOR HER THAN A MILLINERS.IN A HANDSOME FRAME ON THE MANTELSHELF STOOD THE LATEST PORTRAIT OFHER MOTHER WHICH ALDYTH HAD RECEIVED. A SIMILAR ONE REDUCED IN SIZEALDYTH WORE CONSTANTLY IN A GOLD LOCKET SUSPENDED BY A SLENDER CHAINFROM HER NECK. IT WAS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A LADY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEENTHIRTY YEARS OF AGE BUT LOOKED NO OLDER WITH A BEAUTIFUL FACEFAULTLESS IN FORM AND FEATURE AND LUXURIANT MASSES OF HAIR DRESSEDHIGH ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AFTER THE FASHION OF THE DAY. THE POSEOF THE HEAD WAS QUEENLY THE EXQUISITE LIPS HAD A SOMEWHAT DISDAINFULCURL AS THOUGH CONSCIOUS OF THEIR BEAUTY. IT WAS A FACE WHICH DEMANDEDADMIRATION WHETHER IT WOULD AS READILY CALL FORTH LOVE THE PORTRAITDID NOT REVEAL. IT IS NEVER SAFE TO JUDGE A PERSON FROM A PHOTOGRAPH.THIS WAS ALDYTHS BEAUTIFUL MOTHER OF WHOM SHE HAD DREAMED ALL HERLIFE. OFTEN DID HER EYES REST ON THE PORTRAIT WITH A SENSE OF HUNGRYYEARNING LOVE AND SHE LONGED FOR THE TIME WHEN SHE COULD LOOK INTOHER MOTHERS FACE AND MEET THE KISS OF HER SWEET LIPS. WITH PASSINGYEARS THE LONGING CAME TO HAVE SOMEWHAT OF THE BITTERNESS OF A DEFERREDHOPE. THERE WERE HOURS WHEN IT WAS POSITIVE PAIN TO ALDYTH TO THINK OFTHE LOVE SHE HAD MISSED THROUGH THE LONG SEPARATION FROM HER MOTHER.BUT HER NATURE WAS TOO BRIGHT AND HOPEFUL FOR THIS THOUGHT TO SADDENHER LONG. SHE WAS MORE WONT TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE PERFECT JOY OF THELONGDEFERRED MEETING AND DREAM OF THE HAPPINESS THAT WOULD THEN BEHERS.NEAR MRS. STANTONS PORTRAIT WERE PORTRAITS OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS WHOHAD BEEN BORN TO HER IN AUSTRALIA. THEY WERE TAKEN AS CHILDREN BUTEVEN THESE JUVENILE PORTRAITS SHOWED THAT THE ELDER ONE A GIRL ABOUTTHIRTEEN HAD INHERITED THE BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER WHILE THE LITTLEONE DARK HEAVYBROWED AND SOMEWHAT STOLIDLOOKING WAS UNLIKELY TODEVELOP GOOD LOOKS.ALDYTHS EYES TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO HER MOTHERS PICTURE AS SHE LAIDDOWN HER PEN AFTER SIGNING HERSELF YOUR EVERLOVING DAUGHTER.OH MOTHER WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME SHE CRIED IN HER HEART.IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD HER OWN WAY ALDYTH WOULD LONG AGO HAVE SAILED TOJOIN HER MOTHER AT MELBOURNE BUT MRS. STANTON HAD REASONS FOR WISHINGTHAT ALDYTH SHOULD REMAIN AT WOODHAM WITH HER AUNT. FIVE MILES FROMWOODHAM LAY WYNDHAM THE FAMILY ESTATE OF THE LORRAINES AND AT WYNDHAMHALL LIVED ALDYTHS GRANDUNCLE AN OLD BACHELOR STRONGWILLEDCROTCHETY ECCENTRIC AND POSSESSED OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH.STEPHEN LORRAINE WAS THE ELDEST AND THE LAST OF THREE BROTHERS WHO HADBEEN WELLKNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WOODHAM. HIS BROTHER WILLIAMHAD PRACTISED AS A MEDICAL MAN THERE WINNING MUCH LOVE AND HONOURBUT HE DIED AT THE AGE OF FIFTY LEAVING TWO CHILDREN A SON AND ADAUGHTER. THE SON A HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITHHIS UNCLE STEPHEN AND WAS LOOKED UPON AS HIS HEIR. WITH HIS UNCLESAPPROVAL HE MADE THE ARMY HIS PROFESSION. STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD ADECIDED NOTION THAT HIS HEIR MUST CONFORM TO HIS WILL IN EVERYTHINGAND AS LONG AS THE YOUNG MAN DID SO ALL WENT WELL.BUT A TIME CAME IN CAPTAIN LORRAINES HISTORY WHEN LOVE PROVEDSTRONGER THAN EXPEDIENCY AND HE DARED HIS UNCLES ANGER BY MARRYINGINTO AN ESSEX FAMILY FOR WHICH OLD STEPHEN HAD A PARTICULAR DISLIKE.IT WAS AN OFFENCE NOT TO BE CONDONED AND STEPHEN LORRAINE AT ONCEANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING HIS PROPERTY TO THE ONLY SON OF HISBROTHER JAMES WHO HAD TAKEN HOLY ORDERS AND AFTER OFFICIATING FOR AWHILE AS A CURATE AT WOODHAM HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO A LIVING IN THENORTH OF ENGLAND. AT HIS UNCLES REQUEST THIS YOUNG MAN GUY LORRAINEBY NAME CAME TO WOODHAM AND TOOK UP HIS ABODE AT THE HALL. HE BROUGHTWITH HIM A DELICATE YOUNG WIFE AND A BRIGHT BOY OF TWO YEARS.MEANWHILE CAPTAIN LORRAINE THE DISCARDED HEIR DISAPPOINTED IN HISMARRIED LIFE AND DEPRESSED BY DISEASE WAS WANDERING FROM PLACE TOPLACE SEEKING HEALTH AND VAINLY HOPING THAT HIS UNCLE WOULD RELENTTOWARDS HIM. IF THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH STIRRED A TOO LATE REGRET WITHINTHE HEART OF OLD STEPHEN LORRAINE HE SHOWED NO SIGN OF IT UNLESS THEINCREASED BITTERNESS OF FEELING HE MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIS NEPHEWSWIDOW MIGHT BE SO REGARDED. HE HATED THE VERY NAME OF ALDYTHS MOTHERBUT HE EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE THE LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN LEFT INTHE CARE OF HER FATHERS SISTER AT WOODHAM AND AS SOON AS HE SAW HERALDYTH WON HER WAY TO HIS HEART.A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LORRAINE GUY LORRAINES YOUNGWIFE ALSO PASSED AWAY SO THAT WHEN ALDYTHS MOTHER FINALLY LEFT HER TOHER AUNTS CARE MISS LORRAINEOR LUCY LORRAINE AS EVERY ONE CALLEDHER IN THOSE DAYSHAD AS GOOD AS TWO MOTHERLESS CHILDREN TO LOVE ANDCHERISH. LITTLE GUY AND ALDYTH WERE CONSTANTLY TOGETHER. IF GUY WERENOT SPENDING THE DAY AT MISS LORRAINES COTTAGE ALDYTH WOULD BEPLAYING WITH HIM AT THE HALL TO HER CHILDISH MIND THE MOST DELIGHTFULPLACE IN THE WORLD FOR STEPHEN LORRAINE MADE A GREAT PET OF THE TINYDAUGHTER OF HIS FAVOURITE NEPHEW. HE WOULD WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE ANDGARDEN WITH THE LITTLE DAMSEL SEATED ON HIS SHOULDER CLINGING TO HISROUGH WIRY LOCKS AND ALDYTHS EARLIEST RIDES WERE TAKEN ON A LITTLESHETLAND PONY ATTACHED BY A REIN TO THE STOUT COB RIDDEN BY HERGRANDUNCLE. THE SERVANTS AT THE HALL WHISPERED TO EACH OTHER THAT THESQUIRE CARED MORE FOR THE GIRL THAN FOR THE BOY AND THEY FOUND THECAUSE IN ALDYTHS STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO HER FATHER.BUT AS YOUNG GUY GREW INTO A ROBUST HIGHSPIRITED BOY HE TOO WON HISGRANDUNCLES AFFECTION AND WHEN BY HIS FATHERS SUDDEN DEATH FROM ANACCIDENT IN THE HUNTINGFIELD HE WAS MADE AS IT SEEMED THE HEIR TOWYNDHAM MOST PERSONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BELIEVED THAT IT WAS STEPHENLORRAINES INTENTION THAT THE COUSINS SHOULD MARRY AND WYNDHAM THUSBECOME THE HOME AND INHERITANCE OF THEM BOTH. BUT UP TO THE TIME ATWHICH OUR STORY COMMENCES WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE BOTH OF AGE NOONE HAD HEARD OLD STEPHEN GIVE THE LEAST HINT OF ANY SUCH INTENTION.SO FAR HE HAD BEEN CONTENT TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE JUDGINGPERHAPS FROM HIS PAST EXPERIENCE THAT BY ACTIVE INTERFERENCE HE MIGHTDEFEAT HIS OWN ENDS.THE OLD MAN HAD LONG OUTLIVED HIS TWO BROTHERS AND HE HAD SEEN SEVERALOF THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF HIS FAMILY PASS AWAY BUT HE WAS STILLHALE AND HEARTY THOUGH IN HIS EIGHTIETH YEAR. ALDYTH CONTINUED VERYDEAR TO HIM AND HE LIKED TO HAVE HER OFTEN AT THE HALL. AND IT WASBECAUSE OF HER UNCLES AFFECTION FOR HER THAT MRS. STANTON WISHEDALDYTH TO REMAIN AT WOODHAM. WHEN THE GIRL IN HER LETTERS PLEADED TOBE ALLOWED TO JOIN HER MOTHER MRS. STANTON WOULD REPLY THAT SHE FELTIT WOULD BE WRONG TO TAKE ALDYTH FROM THE POOR OLD MAN WHO EVIDENTLYFOUND SUCH COMFORT IN HER SOCIETY.DO ALL YOU CAN TO PLEASE YOUR UNCLE DARLING HER MOTHER WROTE. MAKEIT YOUR DUTY TO CHEER HIS OLD AGE AND BY SO DOING YOU MAY ATONE FORTHE HARM I DID WHEN MARRIED YOUR FATHER AND SO DEPRIVED HIM OF HISUNCLES FAVOUR. WHO KNOWS HE MAY EVEN COME TO FORGIVE POOR ME FOR YOURDEAR SAKE.BUT AS YET STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD SHOWN NO SIGN OF FORGIVING MRS.STANTON. HE PREFERRED TO REGARD HER AS ONE WHO HAD NO CONNECTION WITHHIM WHATEVER HAVING PASSED OUT OF HIS FAMILY WHEN SHE MARRIED HERSECOND HUSBAND. TO ALDYTH HE NEVER NAMED HER MOTHER.AS ALDYTH HAVING FINISHED HER LETTER RAN DOWN STAIRS A YOUNG MANWAS ENTERING THE HOUSE WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO FELT AT HOME THERE. HEWAS A TALL BROADCHESTED FELLOW AND HIS SHOOTING SUIT WELL BECAME HISFINE PROPORTIONS. OF FAIR COMPLEXION WHICH THE SUN HAD BROUGHT TO AWARM HUE WITH LIGHT HAIR CURLING CRISPLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD WELLCUTFEATURES AND EYES THAT MIGHT PASS FOR BLUE HE WAS A TYPICAL SPECIMENOF AN ENGLISH COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AND MOST PERSONS CONSIDERED HIM VERYGOODLOOKING. HE WAS CARRYING SEVERAL BRACE OF PARTRIDGES STRUNGTOGETHER. AT THE SIGHT OF ALDYTH HE SMILED BRIGHTLY AND LIFTED HISCAP WITH EASY GRACE.GOOD MORNING ALDYTH HE SAID IM AN EARLY VISITOR. I HAD TO DRIVEA FELLOW UP TO CATCH THE FIRST TRAIN SO I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TOBRING COUSIN SOME BIRDS. THERE ARE SOME FOR MRS.

ALDYTHSSATISFACTION WAS MORE QUIETLY EVINCED BUT HER FACE WAS BRIGHT WITHSUBDUED PLEASURE. SHE RATHER SHRANK FROM THE EAGER WHISPERS IN WHICHKITTY WHOSE HEAD WAS TURNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS MADE HER OBSERVATIONSON EVERY ONE WHO APPEARED.TO THE NO SMALL ASTONISHMENT OF HIS COUSIN GUY LORRAINE WAS PRESENTSEATED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HILDA ON WHOM HE WAS BESTOWING A GOODDEAL OF ATTENTION. MISS LORRAINE HAD GIVEN HER LITTLE MUSICAL PARTY AFORTNIGHT EARLIER AND GUY HAD MADE MR. GLYNNES ACQUAINTANCE. BUT THENEW TUTOR DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE MADE A MORE FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION ONHIM ON THAT OCCASION THAN AT FIRST SIGHT. GUY CONTINUED TO FIND MUCHTO RIDICULE IN HIM. PERHAPS THE INTEREST WHICH ALDYTH AND HER FRIENDSMANIFESTED IN MR. GLYNNE AND THEIR ENTHUSIASM ABOUT THE LECTURESKINDLED IN GUY SOME UNCONSCIOUS JEALOUSY.THE LECTURER HAD STEPPED ON TO THE LOW PLATFORM HE HAD PLACED HISMANUSCRIPT ON THE READING DESK AND WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN HIS LECTUREWHEN THE ARRIVAL OF A LATECOMER CREATED SUCH A STIR IN THE AUDIENCEAS OBLIGED HIM TO WAIT FOR A FEW MOMENTS. A YOUNG LADY DRESSED IN THEMOST EXTREME STYLE OF FASHIONABLE ATTIRE CAME SWEEPING DOWN THE ROOM.SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY BUT FOR THE ELABORATE GET UP BY WHICHSHE ENDEAVOURED TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO HERSELF. THE MASS OF LIGHTFRIZZY HAIR WHICH SHADED HER EYES COMPLETELY CONCEALED ANY INTELLECTUALATTRACTION HER COUNTENANCE MIGHT POSSESS AND THE PEARL POWDER LAVISHLYAPPLIED TO IT REDUCED HER COMPLEXION TO AN UNNATURAL DEADNESS OF HUEAND RENDERED INVISIBLE THE QUICK CHANGES OF COLOUR THE SUBTLE PLAY OFEXPRESSION ON WHICH THE CHARM OF A WOMANS FACE LARGELY DEPENDS.BUT HOWEVER OTHERS MIGHT CRITICIZE HER MISS CLARA DAWTREY SEEMED FULLYSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE PAINS DEVOTED TO HER TOILET. IT GAVEHER PLEASURE TO FEEL THAT ALL EYES WERE FIXED ON HER AS SHE PASSED DOWNTHE ROOM PUSHING HER WAY TO THE FRONT THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUS THATTHERE WERE NO VACANT SEATS IN THAT DIRECTION. WHEN AT LAST SHE HALTEDWITH A DRAMATIC AIR OF DISMAY WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE LECTURERA GENTLEMAN ROSE TO GIVE HER HIS CHAIR AND AFTER A FAINT PROTESTSHE DROPPED LANGUIDLY INTO IT. THE LECTURER WHO HAD BEEN SOMEWHATANXIOUSLY WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE YOUNG LADY CLEARED HIS BROWAND BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE AUDIENCE.WELL WHISPERED KITTY IN ALDYTHS EAR I DO HOPE CLARA DAWTREY ISSATISFIED WITH THE SENSATION SHE HAS CREATED. THE IDEA OF HER COMING TOLITERATURE LECTURESBUT ALDYTHS EYES WERE ON MR. GLYNNE AND SHE WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO LOSENO WORD TO PAY MUCH HEED TO KITTY.JOHN GLYNNE WAS A GOOD SPEAKER. HE HAD A FULL DEEP MUSICAL VOICE.HE BEGAN HIS LECTURE IN A CALM QUIET MANNER WHICH WAS NEVERTHELESSIMPRESSIVE. BUT AS HE WENT ON HE SOON BEGAN TO DISPLAY THE FIRE ANDENERGY OF ONE WHO WAS KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT WITH WHICH HEHAD TO DEAL. HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO DISPLAYSOME TIMIDITY IN ADDRESSING A STRANGE AUDIENCE BUT HIS MANNER WASSINGULARLY FEARLESS AND UNAFFECTED. HE APPEARED TOO MUCH IN EARNEST TOBE TROUBLED WITH SELFCONSCIOUSNESS.OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKETH NO MATTER WHATTHE SUBJECT AND THAT ONE LECTURE WAS TO ALDYTH LORRAINE AT LEAST AREVELATION OF THE MAN. IT SHOWED HER THAT JOHN GLYNNE WAS A RELIGIOUSMANRELIGIOUS IN THE HIGHEST AND DEEPEST MEANING OF THE TERM ALARGEHEARTED MAN TO WHOM ALL LIFE WAS DEAR ONE WHO COULD ENJOY MUCHBUT ONE EVER ACTUATED BY A STRONG INFLEXIBLE SENSE OF DUTY.THE FIRST LECTURE WAS INTRODUCTORY DEALING WITH THE GENERAL CHARACTEROF THE POETRY OF THE AGE PRECEDING THE ERA OF WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE.THERE WERE A FEW EARNEST WORDS CONCERNING POETRY WHICH STIRREDALDYTHS HEART WITH DELIGHT.I WILL NOT ATTEMPT A DEFINITION OF POETRY THE LECTURER SAID. ALLDEFINITIONS ARE ALIKE INADEQUATE THE SUBTLE ESSENCE WHICH MAKES THEPRECIOUSNESS OF POETRY SEEMS TO ESCAPE US WHEN WE TRY TO DEFINE IT.BUT LET IT BE SAID ONCE FOR ALL THAT THAT CANNOT BE POETRY WHICH ISARTIFICIAL IN ITS NATURE STILTED AND AFFECTED. TRUE POETRY HAS ANINTIMATE RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE. IT APPEALS TO EVERY HEART OF MANTO THE WAYFARER AS WELL AS TO THE SCHOLAR IT TOUCHES THE SIMPLESTDETAILS OF HOMELY LIFE IT ILLUMINES THE JOYS AND SORROWS WHICH ARE THEHERITAGE OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY. WHAT WOULD OUR LIFE BE WORTH IF THEREWERE NO POETRY IN ITYET EVEN NOW THERE ARE THOSE WHO REGARD THE POETS AS DREAMERS ANDDEPRECIATE THEIR VALUE IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF THE SOCALLED MEN OFACTION. DREAMERS YEA VERILY BUT THEIR VISIONS UPLIFT AND STRENGTHENUS AND MAKE OUR LIFE MORE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE MORE TRUE. WE ARE SUCHSTUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE OF. WE LIVE IN DREAMS AND WHO SHALL SAYHOW MUCH THE GREAT HEROES OF HISTORY AND MEN OF ACTION IN ALL AGES HAVEOWED TO THE VISION GLORIOUS BY WHICH THEIR POETS STIMULATED THEM TONOBLEST ENDEAVOUR POETRY IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE EXPRESSION OF TRUTHAND THE TRUE POET IS THE SEER THE INSPIRER THE TEACHER OF MEN. LET NOONE FEAR THAT THE STUDY OF POETRY WILL UNFIT MEN FOR PRACTICAL LIFE ITSHOULD RATHER MAKE LIFE MORE REAL AND EARNEST AS IT REVEALS THE GRANDAND THE AWFUL POSSIBILITIES THAT LIE BEFORE EVERY SOUL OF MAN.ALDYTH LISTENED WITH JOY TO THESE WORDS. WAS THE LECTURER CONSCIOUS OFTHE SOFT LIQUID GLOW IN THE GREY EYES FIXED SO EARNESTLY ON HIM DID HESEE HOW ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ALDYTHS COUNTENANCE BECAME AS IT CAUGHTAND REFLECTED HIS THOUGHT YES FOR NOW AND AGAIN HIS EYES MET THE FULLFLASH OF GLAD INTELLIGENCE THAT LEAPED INTO ALDYTHS AND HE SPOKE THEBETTER FOR KNOWING THAT HE HAD ONE PERFECT LISTENER.THE LECTURE OVER THE STIR AND BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE AROSE IN THE HALL.EVERYBODY WAS DISCUSSING THE LECTURE AND THE GENERAL FEELING SEEMEDONE OF SATISFACTION. GUY LORRAINE INDEED YAWNED AND STRETCHED HIMSELFAND PROFESSED TO BE GLAD THAT THE LECTURE WAS ENDED THEREBY EXCITINGTHE INDIGNATION OF HILDA BLAND WHOSE REPROOFS HE SEEMED TO ENJOY.I AM GLAD YOU WERE PLEASED HE SAID BUT FOR MY PART I FOUND ITDULL.DULL I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU SAID HILDA. IT WAS THE GREATESTINTELLECTUAL TREAT I HAVE HAD FOR A LONG TIME.WELL I DO NOT PROFESS TO BE INTELLECTUAL REPLIED GUY DRAWINGHIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND LOOKING AS IF HE PRIDED HIMSELF ONTHE FACT. I SUPPOSE YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE THE ESSAY FOR MR. GLYNNE.I SHALL TRY CERTAINLY SAID HILDA AND I HOPE ALDYTH WILL. I CANNOTANSWER FOR KITTY.I SHOULD THINK YOU MIGHT SAID KITTY OVERHEARING HER WORDS. I WRITEAN ESSAY ON THE CHARACTER OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY I SHOULD PITYMR. GLYNNE IF HE HAD TO READ IT. NO I AM LIKE YOU GUY. I GO IN FORWHAT IS PRACTICAL. I AM NOT A BOOKWORM LIKE HILDA AND ALDYTH.KITTY HOW CAN YOU TALK LIKE THAT AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD TONIGHTCRIED HILDA IN A TONE OF DISGUST.BUT KITTY ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID THAT THOUGH SHE HAD ENJOYED THELECTURE SHE WAS NOT PREPARED TO GIVE HER DAYS AND NIGHTS TO THE STUDYOF POETRY FOR THE SAKE OF MR. GLYNNE OR ANY ONE ELSE.CLARA DAWTREY WAS PROFESSING HERSELF DELIGHTED WITH THE LECTURE IN LOUDTONES INTENDED TO REACH THE EAR OF THE LECTURER. BUT SHE SAW TO HERANNOYANCE THAT HE WAS PAYING NO ATTENTION TO HER. HE HAD STEPPED FROMTHE PLATFORM AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH MISS LORRAINE AND RECEIVEDHER CONGRATULATIONS HE WAS LEANING ACROSS A BENCH TO TALK TO HER NIECE.ALDYTHS FACE STILL WORE THE GLOW OF EXCITEMENT. SHE WAS LOOKING HERBEST AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HER FACE WAS RADIANT WITH SPIRITUAL LIGHT.CLARA SAW THE BEAUTY AND IT VEXED HER. SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN NO GOODREASON FOR DISLIKING ALDYTH BUT DISLIKE HER SHE DID. PERHAPS SHE WASDIMLY CONSCIOUS OF THE CONTRAST THAT ALDYTH IN HER SIMPLICITY ANDREFINEMENT PRESENTED TO HERSELF. PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE ALDYTH BELONGEDTO A DIFFERENT SETFOR THE SOCIETY OF WOODHAM LIKE THAT OF MOST LITTLECOUNTRY TOWNS WAS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL CLIQUESAND SHE SUSPECTED HEROF LOOKING DOWN UPON HERSELF. BUT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO THINK SO OFALDYTH. KITTY AND HILDA BLAND HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL TO VEIL THEIRSCORN OF CLARA DAWTREYS VULGARITY AND FASTNESS BUT ALDYTH INVARIABLYTREATED THE GIRL WITHE FAULTLESS THOUGH DISTANT COURTESY.IT ANNOYED CLARA THAT MR. GLYNNE SHOULD STAND TALKING TO ALDYTH FORSOME MINUTES.IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT MISS ALDYTH LORRAINE MEANS TO BE MR. GLYNNESPET PUPIL SHE OBSERVED TO A YOUNG MAN WITH WHOM SHE WAS TALKING. IWRITE PAPERS NO THANK YOU. I HAVE NO WISH TO COMPETE WITH MISS ALDYTHLORRAINE.MR. GREENWOOD HAD INVITED MR. GLYNNE TO SUP AT HIS HOUSE AFTER THELECTURESUPPERS AND NOT LATE DINNERS WERE THE FASHION AT WOODHAM.MRS. GREENWOOD WHO HAD NO DAUGHTER WAS PRESSING MISS LORRAINE TO COMEWITH ALDYTH AND MAKE THE SUPPER MORE CHEERFUL. MISS LORRAINE YIELDEDTO HER PERSUASIONS SO CLARA DAWTREY LINGERING ABOUT THE HALL TO THELAST HAD THE CHAGRIN OF SEEING ALDYTH WALK DOWN THE HIGH STREET TO THEBANKERS HOUSE ACCOMPANIED BY JOHN GLYNNE WHO SHELTERED HER WITH HISUMBRELLA FROM THE SLIGHT SHOWER THAT WAS FALLING.MR. GLYNNE SAID ALDYTH AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER I AM SO GLAD YOUSAID WHAT YOU DID ABOUT POETRY TONIGHT. SO MANY PERSONS HAVE THE IDEATHAT POETRY RENDERS US DREAMY AND UNPRACTICAL. EVEN MY AUNT THOUGH ASYOU KNOW SHE IS NO ENEMY TO CULTURE TALKS IN THAT WAY SOMETIMES. ANDMRS. BLAND VEXES HILDA BY TRYING TO CHECK HER LOVE OF POETRY SHE SEEMSTO THINK IT MAKES HER SENTIMENTAL AND IDLE. AND REALLY HILDA IS RATHERALDYTH BROKE OFF SUDDENLY. LOYALTY TO HER FRIEND SEEMED TO FORBID HERTO SPEAK OF HER DEFECTS.I AM GLAD YOU THINK I SPOKE TO THE POINT SAID JOHN GLYNNE WITHOUTAPPEARING TO OBSERVE ALDYTHS ABRUPT PAUSE. PERHAPS IT IS MY MISSIONHERE TO TEACH SOME OF MY HEARERS THE RIGHT USE OF POETRY. LIKE EVERYOTHER BLESSING IT MAY BE MISUSED. IT IS THE WINE OF LIFE BUT WE MAYLET IT STRENGTHEN ONLY OUR SELFISHNESS AND VANITY. THERE IS ALWAYSDANGER TO THE REFLECTIVE MIND OF BECOMING ABSORBED IN ABSTRACTIONSAND NOTIONS WHICH ARE NEVER MADE FRUITFULIN A WORD OF CHERISHINGSENTIMENTALITY INSTEAD OF TRUE SENTIMENTS.THAT IS IT SAID ALDYTH EAGERLY YOU HAVE EXPRESSED WHAT I HAVEOFTEN THOUGHT.YES CONTINUED JOHN GLYNNE THOUGHTFULLY. POETRY SHOULD NOT MAKE USDREAMY USELESS INERT IT SHOULD RATHER STIMULATE US TO THE HIGHESTSERVICE BY MAKING CLEAR TO US THE TRUE MEANING OF LIFETHAT MANSBLESSEDNESS DOES NOT CONSIST IN ANY MATERIAL HAPPINESS BUT IN SERVICEIN DOING HIS DUTY.DUTY AH YES SAID ALDYTH EARNESTLY. DO YOU KNOW I THINK I AMBEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF WORDSWORTHS ODE TO DUTY. ITUSED TO PUZZLE ME BUT NOW I SEE THE BEAUTY OF THOSE WORDS   NOR KNOW WE ANYTHING SO FAIR     AS IS THE SMILE UPON THY FACE.THEY WERE PASSING BENEATH A STREET LAMP AND LOOKING UP ALDYTH CAUGHTTHE STRANGE WISTFUL GLANCE WITH WHICH HER COMPANION REGARDED HER EREHE SAID IN LOW GRAVE TONESARE YOU INDEED BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND IT IT TAKES A DEAL OFLEARNING. NO ONE CAN RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND THE POEM WHO HAS NOT REALIZEDTHE WHOLE FORCE OF THAT WORD STERN THAT THE POET SO APTLY USESSTERNDAUGHTER STERN LAWGIVER NOR HOW ESSENTIAL TO THE BONDMAN OF DUTYIS THE SPIRIT OF SELFSACRIFICE.HE SPOKE SO SERIOUSLY THAT ALDYTH FELT AWED AND FOR A MOMENT THEGLADNESS OF HER MOOD WAS CHECKED. WOULD A TIME COME IN HER LIFE WHENDUTY WOULD WEAR NO SMILE UP HER FACE BUT ASSUME THE ATTITUDE OF ASTERN INEXORABLE LAWGIVER DEMANDING THE RENUNCIATION OF HAPPINESSTHEY WERE AT MR. GREENWOODS HOUSE. THE LIGHT FROM THE OPENING DOORFELL ON ALDYTHS FACE AND SHOWED THE SHADOW THERE. BUT AS SHE MET JOHNGLYNNES QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AND REASSURING SMILE THE SHADOWVANISHED AND ALDYTH RAN LIGHTLY UP THE STEPS.CHAPTER V.A DAY AT WYNDHAM HALL.ALDYTH AND HILDA WERE VERY BUSY DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THEY WEREWRITING THEIR ESSAYS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURYPOETRY AND WHENEVER THEY MET THEY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT ANDMANIFESTED CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT AS TO THE RESULT OF THEIR WORK.HILDA INDEED WAS SO ABSORBED IN THIS NEW INTEREST THAT KITTYLAUGHINGLY DECLARED THAT SHE WAS LOST TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ANDWOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIVIOUS OF EVERY DUTY SHE OWED TO HER CONTEMPORARIESIF SHE HAD NOT LOOKED AFTER HER.IT IS WELL I AM A PROSAIC MORTAL KITTY WOULD SAY AS SHE ARRANGEDFLOWERS WATERED THE PLANTS IN THE CONSERVATORY AND ATTENDED TO THEVARIOUS LITTLE DETAILS ON WHICH THE BEAUTY AND COMFORT OF A HOMEDEPEND NOT A ROOM IN THE HOUSE WOULD BE FIT TO BE SEEN IF THEY WERELEFT TO HILDA.AND HILDA WOULD SMILE DREAMILY AND WITH AN UNTROUBLED CONSCIENCEDEVOTE ALL HER TIME TO READING AND STUDY. KITTY LIKED ACTIVE DUTIESSHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL TASTES WHY SHOULD HILDA INTERFERE TO PREVENTHER PERFORMING AS MANY SUCH DUTIES AS POSSIBLEALDYTH HAD NO SISTER TO RELIEVE HER OF UNWELCOME TASKS AND MISSLORRAINE WHO WAS SO MUCH ENGAGED OUTSIDE HER HOME EXPECTED HER NIECETO ASSIST HER IN DOMESTIC MATTERS. ALDYTH DID NOT LET HER INTERESTIN THE LITERATURE LECTURES LEAD HER TO SLIGHT THESE. EACH DUTY WASCONSCIENTIOUSLY DISCHARGED BUT BY RISING EARLY AND MAKING THE MOST OFEVERY OPPORTUNITY SHE MANAGED TO SECURE TIME FOR READING AND WRITING.MR. GLYNNES SECOND LECTURE WHICH DESCRIBED THE INFLUENCE OF THEFRENCH REVOLUTION ON ENGLISH LITERATURE WAS EVEN MORE INTERESTINGTHAN THE FORMER ONE HAD BEEN. ALDYTHS PAPER WAS RETURNED TO HER WITHA FEW WORDS OF COMMENDATION WRITTEN ON IT. HILDAS TOO WAS MARKEDGOOD BUT IT WAS CRITICIZED AS BEING RATHER TOO DIFFUSE AND IN SOMERESPECTS NOT TO THE POINT. HILDA WHO HAD SPENT HOURS OVER HER ESSAYAND FLATTERED HERSELF THAT IT WAS WELL DONE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FINDIT UNEQUAL TO ALDYTHS.ALDYTHS IS THE BEST ESSAY SAID KITTY TO MISS LORRAINE AS THEYMET NEAR THE DOOR OF THE HALL. SHE SPOKE IN LOUD CLEAR TONES AS SHEGENERALLY DID AND HER WORDS WERE HEARD BY CLARA DAWTREY TO WHOM MISSLORRAINE HAD JUST BEEN SPEAKING.THAT MISS ALDYTH LORRAINE SHOULD STAND FIRST IS ONLY WHAT ONE WOULDEXPECT CLARA REMARKED WITH A SIMPER.KITTY GAVE HER RATHER A HAUGHTY LOOK OF INQUIRY. BUT MISS DAWTREY HADTURNED TO GREET AN ACQUAINTANCE AND KITTYS LOOK WAS APPARENTLY LOSTON HER.NOW WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT I WONDER SAID KITTY LOWERING HERVOICE.I AM SURE I CANNOT SAY REPLIED MISS LORRAINE RATHER BELYING HERWORDS THE NEXT MOMENT HOWEVER BY REMARKING I HOPE THERE WILL BENO NONSENSE OF THAT KIND. THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A PLACE FOR GOSSIP ASWOODHAM.JOHN GLYNNE NO LONGER FELT HIMSELF A STRANGER TO PEOPLE WHO GATHERED TOHEAR HIM LECTURE. THE SOCIETY OF A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN IS NOT USUALLYRELUCTANT TO SHOW HOSPITALITY TO A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND HIGHPERSONAL CREDENTIALS AND WOODHAM WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.THE YOUNG TUTOR SOMETIMES WAS EMBARRASSED BY THE NUMBER OF INVITATIONSHE RECEIVED AND HAD TO USE CONSIDERABLE TACT IN ORDER TO AVOIDOFFENDING ANY OF THE MANY PERSONS WHO WISHED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HISACQUAINTANCE. HIS FRANK GENIAL MANNER AND GOOD SPIRITS MADE HIMPOPULAR IN EVERY HOME. HE WAS NOT MUSICAL IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THETERM BUT HE COULD APPRECIATE GOOD MUSIC AND SO WAS A WELCOME ADDITIONTO THE MUSICAL PARTIES FOR WHICH THE LITTLE TOWN WAS FAMOUS.THERE WERE TWO HOUSES IN WHICH JOHN GLYNNE FELT PERFECTLY AT HOMEAND AN INVITATION TO EITHER WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE TO HIM. THESE WEREMRS. BLANDS AND MISS LORRAINES. HIS LODGINGS BEING CLOSE BY IN THELONGBRIDGE ROAD IT WAS EASY TO DROP INTO EITHER. NEEDLESS TO SAY GOODMRS. BLANDS HEART WENT OUT TOWARDS THE LONELY YOUNG MAN AND FOR THESAKE OF HIS ABSENT MOTHER SHE SHOWED HIM MANY A MOTHERLY KINDNESS. ANDHE ENJOYED THE LIFE AND FREEDOM HE FOUND IN HER HOME. HE WAS SURE THATHIS SISTER WOULD LIKE THE GIRLS. ALDYTH LORRAINE TOO MARY COULD NOTHELP LIKING HER. SHE WAS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT FROM ANY GIRL HE HAD EVERMET BEFORE.JOHN GLYNNE LITTLE SUSPECTED THAT HE NEVER RAN UP THE BLANDS STEPSOR STOPPED IN THE HIGH STREET TO SPEAK TO THE BLAND GIRLS OR THEIRFRIEND ALDYTH WITHOUT A PAIR OF KEEN DARK EYES NOTING THAT HE DIDSO. THE EYES WERE THOSE OF THE BLANDS NEIGHBOUR MISS TABITHA RUDKINAN ELDERLY MAIDEN LADY GRANDAUNT TO CLARA DAWTREY. HER HOUSE STOODOPPOSITE TO MRS. BLANDS JUST AT THE BEND OF THE HIGH STREET WHERE ANARROW LANE RAN INTO IT AND WAS SO BUILT THAT THE WINDOWS COMMANDEDTWO DIRECTIONS. THE USE WHICH ITS OCCUPANT MADE OF THESE WINDOWS HADLED THE BLAND GIRLS TO NAME THE HOUSE THE OBSERVATORY. NOTHING THATHAPPENED IN THE HIGH STREET COULD ESCAPE THE OBSERVATION OF MISS RUDKINAND HER HIRED COMPANION MISS PURKISS.IN HER WAY MISS RUDKIN WAS A POWER IN THE LITTLE TOWN BUT ALAS ITWAS A POWER FOR EVIL. SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE UNHAPPY SPINSTERS WHO HAVEBROUGHT A SLUR UPON THE CHARACTER OF ELDERLY SINGLE WOMEN. OF COLDSELFISH NATURE AND ILLDISCIPLINED MIND WITHOUT OCCUPATION OR ANYCLOSE TIES OF AFFECTION SHE HAD GROWN MORE AND MORE UNAMIABLE MORESUSPICIOUS MORE PRONE TO BELIEVE THE WORST OF HER FELLOW MORTALSWITH ADVANCING YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS NO KINDLY INTEREST SHE TOOK INHER NEIGHBOURS THE INTEREST WAS INTENSE. NO ONE KNEW SO MUCH AS MISSRUDKIN ABOUT ALL THAT HAPPENED OR MIGHT HAPPEN AT WOODHAM. SHE WAS THEMOST ARRANT GOSSIPMONGER IN THE PLACE IF INDEED SHE MIGHT NOT BEDESCRIBED AS MANUFACTURER OF THAT COMMODITY. ALL THOSE WHO HAD A RELISHFOR THE LATEST PIECE OF SCANDAL AND COULD ENJOY HEARING THE CHARACTEROF A NEIGHBOUR PULLED TO PIECES WITHOUT BEING PARTICULAR AS TO THEACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE WERE WONT TO FREQUENT MISS RUDKINSHOUSE AND MANY OTHERS PAID HER ATTENTION NOT BECAUSE THEY LIKED HERBUT BECAUSE THEY FEARED HER.IT WAS SAID THAT LONG LONG AGO WHEN MISS TABITHA RUDKIN WAS YOUNGAND PERHAPS GOODLOOKING THERE HAD BEEN A TALK OF HER MARRYING STEPHENLORRAINE. NO ONE KNEW MORE THAN THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING BETWEENTHEM NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THE MARRIAGE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE BUTIT WAS CERTAIN THAT MISS RUDKIN HAD STILL CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVEROLD STEPHEN LORRAINE.WHETHER HE WERE ACTUATED BY A SENSE OF HAVING WRONGED HER IN THE PASTOR WHATEVER THE MOTIVE HE INVARIABLY TREATED HER WITH GREAT RESPECT.ON NO DAY DID HE DRIVE DOWN THE TOWN WITHOUT DRAWING UP FOR A MINUTE ATMISS RUDKINS DOOR TO INQUIRE AFTER HER HEALTH OR LEAVE SOME LITTLEPRESENT OF GAME OR FRUIT. NOT SELDOM HE WOULD GO IN TO HAVE A CHAT WITHHER AND GATHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE TOWNSPEOPLE FOR HE TOOHAD AN APPETITE FOR GOSSIP. IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THESE VISITSPRODUCED RESULTS EXCEEDINGLY ANNOYING TO MISS LORRAINE WHO HAD NEVERLIKED THE RUDKINS.ALDYTHS LIFE HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BUSY OR MORE FULL OF INTEREST THANIT WAS NOW. IT SEEMED TO MISS LORRAINE AS SHE WATCHED HER NIECE WITHLOVING EYES AND MARKED THE FRESH ANIMATION IN HER LOOK AND BEARINGTHAT ALDYTH WAS DAILY GROWING PRETTIER. THERE IS INDEED NO BEAUTIFIEROF THE HUMAN FACE LIKE THE GLOW IMPARTED TO IT BY A NOBLE SPIRITUALAND INTELLECTUAL LIFE. HIGH THOUGHTS LEAVE THEIR IMPRESS AND A PUREUNSELFISH SPIRIT WILL ILLUMINE THE HOMELIEST FEATURES.THREE LECTURES HAD BEEN GIVEN AND ALDYTH WAS LOOKING FORWARD WITHGREAT INTEREST TO THE FOURTH WHICH WAS TO TREAT OF WORDSWORTHS WORKAS A POET. IT WAS TUESDAY MORNING AND HAVING COMPLETED HER ROUND OFDOMESTIC DUTIES ALDYTH SAT DOWN TO FINISH THE PAPER SHE WAS WRITINGFOR MR. GLYNNE. SHE WAS JUST FAIRLY LAUNCHED INTO HER TASK WHEN SHEHEARD HER AUNT CALLING TO HER FROM BELOWCOME DOWN ALDYTH GUY IS HERE.ALDYTH LAID DOWN HER PEN WITH A SIGH AND RAN TO OBEY THE SUMMONS.GUY WAS CHATTING WITH MISS LORRAINE IN THE DINING ROOM. HIS DOGCARTSTOOD OUTSIDE THE HOUSE WITH A BOY HOLDING THE SOMEWHAT SPIRITEDHORSE. SINCE HE APPEARED AT THE FIRST LECTURE GUY HAD NOT TAKEN THETROUBLE TO ATTEND ANOTHER BUT HE HAD HAPPENED TO BE AT WOODHAM ON EACHTHURSDAY EVENING AND THE BLANDS HAD FOUND HIM WAITING ON THE STEPS OFTHE TOWN HALL APPARENTLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING THE AUDIENCEDISPERSE.GUY HAS COME TO TAKE US TO WYNDHAM FOR THE DAY SAID MISS LORRAINEAS ALDYTH ENTERED UNCLE WISHES TO SEE US.ALDYTH FELT A PANG OF DISAPPOINTMENT. THE WORK IN WHICH SHE WAS SOINTERESTED MUST BE PUT ASIDE FOR MISS LORRAINE ALWAYS REGARDED HERUNCLES WISHES AS COMMANDS AND ONLY ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD HAVE LEDHER TO DECLINE THIS INVITATION. BUT ALDYTH WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO BESEEN THAT SHE WOULD PREFER TO REMAIN AT HOME.THANK YOU GUY SHE SAID BRIGHTLY IT IS A LOVELY DAY FOR WYNDHAM. ISUPPOSE YOU WOULD LIKE US TO GET READY AT ONCEIF YOU PLEASE SAID GUY. YOU WILL WANT YOUR HABIT ALDYTH. UNCLE HASBOUGHT A NEW MARE ONE THAT CARRIES A LADY BEAUTIFULLY AND YOU ARE TOTRY HER PACES THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU WILL.ALDYTHS EYES BRIGHTENED. SHE WAS FOND OF RIDING AND THE PROSPECT OFTHE NEW MARE WAS DELIGHTFUL. SHE RAN TO GET READY BUT EVEN WITH SUCHA PLEASURE IN ANTICIPATION SHE CAST A REGRETFUL GLANCE AT THE BOOKSAND PAPERS SCATTERED ON HER WRITINGTABLE.IN A SHORT TIME THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO WYNDHAM. ALDYTH SAT ON THEBACK SEAT OF THE DOGCART AND WAS CONTENT TO LET THE OTHER TWO DO THETALKING. FOR NEARLY FIVE MILES THEY FOLLOWED THE LONGBRIDGE ROAD ADREARY ROAD RUNNING ON A DEAD LEVEL ALL THE WAY WITH NOTHING TO BREAKTHE MONOTONY OF FLAT FIELDS SAVE AN OCCASIONAL COTTAGE OR A WINDMILLSLOWLY REVOLVING ITS LONG ARMS. BUT IT WAS A LOVELY OCTOBER DAY. THEREWAS A CRISP FRESHNESS IN THE AIR WITHOUT ITS BEING COLD. THE SUN WASSHINING ON THE STUBBLE FIELDS AND ON THE BROWN MUD AND GLEAMING WATEROF THE DISTANT ESTUARY. THE HEDGES WERE BRIGHT WITH SCARLET ROSEHIPSAN ABUNDANCE OF HAWS RUSSET LEAVES AND HERE AND THERE RICH CLUSTERSOF BLACKBERRIES. ALDYTHS EYES WERE QUICK TO DISCERN BEAUTY WHEREVER ITLURKED. SHE LOVED THE COUNTRY AT ALL SEASONS AND UNDER ALL ASPECTS. SHEHAD TRAVELLED LITTLE AND SHE OFTEN LONGED TO VISIT THE MOST BEAUTIFULPARTS OF THE WORLD BUT WHILST SHE WAITED FOR THE REALIZATION OF THISDESIRE SHE MISSED NONE OF THE BEAUTY WHICH NATURE LAVISHES ON EVERYSPOT OF EARTH.AS THEY APPROACHED WYNDHAM GUY TURNED HIS HORSE SHARPLY FROM THE MAINROAD AND THEY ENTERED UPON A LONG CARRIAGE DRIVE WHICH CROSSED TWOFIELDS. THE GATES WERE SET OPEN IN ANTICIPATION OF THEIR ARRIVAL ANDTHEY DROVE STRAIGHT ON THROUGH A RATHER GLOOMY SHRUBBERY TILL THEYEMERGED IN FRONT OF A LONG LOW WHITE HOUSE. A LAWN STRETCHED TO THERIGHT OF IT WITH FLOWERBEDS RATHER UNTIDILY KEPT AND TO THE LEFTLAY A ROUND POND WITH THE BROAD LEAVES OF WATERLILIES FLOATING ON ITSSURFACE. AT THE SOUND OF WHEELS SEVERAL DOGS CAME RUNNING FROM THEBACK OF THE HOUSE BARKING JOYOUSLY. THEY KNEW ALDYTH WELL AND SHECALLED THEM BY THEIR NAMES AND LAUGHED AS THEY MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TOSPRING UP AT THE BACK OF THE DOGCART.THE COMMOTION SOON BROUGHT OUT THE SQUIRE TO WELCOME HIS GUESTS. HEWAS A FINE OLD MAN WONDERFULLY UPRIGHT AND VIGOROUS FOR HIS YEARS. HEWORE A SHABBY VELVETEEN SHOOTING JACKET AND ON HIS HEAD A SOFT BLACKVELVET CAP WHICH HE WAS SCARCELY EVER KNOWN TO LAY ASIDE. THE HAIRWHICH FELL BENEATH IT AND ALMOST TOUCHED HIS SHOULDERS WAS SNOWY WHITEIN VIVID CONTRAST TO HIS CHEEK WHICH HAD A RUDDY GLOW LIKE THAT OF AWINTER APPLE AND TESTIFIED TO A LIFE SPENT LARGELY IN THE OPEN AIRHIS BLUE EYES WERE KEEN AND BRIGHT HE HAD A LARGE HANDSOME NOSE ATHINKLIPPED TIGHTLYCLOSED MOUTH AND A ROUND CLEANLYSHAVEN CHIN.HIS EYES SHONE WITH THEIR KINDLIEST LIGHT AS HE GRASPED ALDYTHS HANDAND HELPED HER TO SPRING FROM THE DOGCART WHILE THE OTHERS DROVEROUND TO THE FRONT DOOR.SO YOUVE COME MISS HE SAID. WHY DID YOU MAKE ME SEND FOR YOU ITSEEMS YOU HAVE NO LEISURE TO VISIT YOUR POOR OLD UNCLE NOWADAYS.INDEED UNCLE WE HAVE TALKED OF COMING BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY BUSYLATELY.BUSY POOH WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO BE BUSY ABOUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOWWELL UNCLE YOU KNOW WE ARE HAVING LITERATURE LECTURES NOW ATWOODHAM AND I HAVE TO STUDY HARD IN ORDER TO GET ALL THE GOOD THAT ICAN FROM THEM.AN IMPATIENT FROWN CAME TO THE OLD MANS FACE.LECTURES PSHAW WHAT GOOD CAN THEY DO YOUA GREAT DEAL I THINK UNCLE SAID ALDYTH CHEERFULLY I AM LEARNINGMANY THINGS I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE.RUBBISH. YOU KNOW ENOUGH. DID YOU NOT GO TO A FIRSTCLASS SCHOOLYES UNCLE BUT WHILST I WAS THERE I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR STUDYINGPOETRY.WHAT DO YOU WANT TO STUDY POETRY FOR IT WILL ONLY PUT IDEAS INTO YOURHEAD THAT ARE BETTER OUT OF IT. I NEVER STUDIED POETRY OR ATTENDEDLECTURES AND I HAVE GOT ON VERY WELL WITHOUT DOING SO.IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REPLY TO THIS EMPHATIC STATEMENT. ALDYTH LEFT ITUNDISPUTED AND TURNED TO CARESS ONE OF THE DOGS.MISS LORRAINE RECEIVED BUT A COLD GREETING FROM HER UNCLE BUT SHEEXPECTED NO OTHER. THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD NEVER BEEN CORDIAL SINCETHE TIME WHEN HE THOUGHT FIT TO DISINHERIT THE BROTHER WHOM SHEPASSIONATELY LOVED. MISS LORRAINE TOOK HER BROTHERS PART AND HADTRIED TO MAKE PEACE FOR HIM WITH HER UNCLE BUT SHE HAD ONLY RECEIVEDTHE NOT INFREQUENT REWARD OF THE PEACEMAKERHER UNCLES DISPLEASURE HADBEEN EXTENDED TO HER.HIS LOVE FOR ALDYTH AND MISS LORRAINES LOVE FOR BOTH THE CHILDRENWHO CLAIMED HER AFFECTION HAD TENDED TO PATCH UP THIS BREACH BUTTHE PATCHING WAS FRAIL AND MISS LORRAINE WAS EVER AWARE THAT HERUNCLE REGARDED HER WITH COLDNESS AND SUSPICION. BUT FOR ALDYTHSSAKE SHE STROVE TO PRESERVE A FRIENDLY FOOTING AT THE HALL AND WASPUNCTILIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO HER UNCLES WISHES.THESE VISITS TO THE HALL WERE SELDOM AGREEABLE TO HER. SHE WAS NOTAFRAID OF THE OLD MAN BUT SHE COULD NOT ENJOY HIS SOCIETY. SHEBELIEVED THAT HE TOOK A SECRET PLEASURE IN ANNOYING HER. HE CERTAINLYHAD A KNACK OF RUBBING HER THE WRONG WAY AND SOMETIMES HE IRRITATEDHER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO RESIST THETEMPTATION TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF HER MIND.DURING LUNCHEON THE TALK WAS ABOUT THE MARE WHICH ALDYTH WAS PRESENTLYTO MOUNT. SHE KNEW THAT HER UNCLE HAD PURCHASED THE ANIMAL ENTIRELY FORHER BENEFIT AND SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM.IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU UNCLE TO GIVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE SHE SAID.POOH POOH HE RETURNED. ONE MUST HAVE A DECENT HORSE OR TWO INONES STABLES AND AS YOU LIKE RIDING YOU MAY AS WELL RIDE HER. BROWNBESS IS GETTING A LITTLE TOO OLD AND STAID FOR YOUR LADYSHIPIT WAS THE VERY DAY FOR A RIDE ALDYTH WAS LONGING TO BE IN THE SADDLE.SOON AFTER LUNCHEON THE HORSES WERE BROUGHT ROUND. THE NEW MARE WAS ABEAUTIFUL CREATURE PALECHESTNUT IN HUE WITH ONE SNOWY FOREFOOT.MISS LORRAINE WHO FLATTERED HERSELF SHE KNEW SOMETHING OF HORSES WASLOUD IN HER ADMIRATION OF HER UNCLES PURCHASE. STEPHEN LORRAINE SAIDLITTLE IN REPLY BUT HIS FACE WAS BRIGHT WITH PLEASURE AS HE CAUGHT THELOOK OF ALDYTHS. HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS AND ASSISTED ALDYTH TO SPRINGINTO THE SADDLE.IT IS YOUR RIGHT I KNOW GUY HE SAID BUT YOU LET AN OLD MANFORESTALL YOU FOR ONCE.GUY LAUGHED CARELESSLY AS HE MOUNTED HIS OWN STEED.ALDYTH WAS A GOOD RIDER AND SHE LOOKED HER BEST ON HORSEBACK. THE DARKBLUE HABIT SHOWED TO PERFECTION HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND SET OFF THEPURE PALENESS OF HER COMPLEXION. HER EYES SHONE WITH HAPPINESS ANDTHERE WAS A GLAD RING HER VOICE AS SHE BADE GOODBYE TO THE TWO WHOSTOOD ON THE STEPS TO WATCH HER RIDE AWAY WITH GUY. MISS LORRAINE FELTLESS CHEERFUL AS SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO SPENDING THE AFTERNOON ALONEWITH HER UNCLE.SHE IS A DEAR GIRL HE REMARKED AS HIS EYES FOLLOWED TWO RIDING DOWNTHE DRIVE AND SHE IS GROWING A HANDSOME GIRL. THEY MAKE A FINE PAIR.THERE WILL NOT BE A BETTERMATCHED COUPLE IN ESSEX.MISS LORRAINE TURNED A STARTLED LOOK UPON HIM.HE MET HER GLANCE AND ARRESTED IT FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS KEEN OLD EYES.YES HE SAID SIGNIFICANTLY I MEAN IT. OF COURSE THOSE TWO WILLMARRY. YOU CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT I CONTEMPLATE ANYTHING ELSEMISS LORRAINE GREW HOT AND THEN COLD. SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY SURPRISED. ITWAS RATHER THE REALIZATION OF A DREAD THAT HAD LONG HAUNTED HER MIND.THE QUESTION IS RATHERWHAT DOES GUY CONTEMPLATE SHE SAID QUICKLY.OH AS TO THAT SAID HER UNCLE COOLLY WHERE COULD HE FIND A MORECHARMING WIFE THAN ALDYTH WOULD MAKE HIM AND WOULD IT NOT BE THE BESTTHING POSSIBLE FOR HERMISS LORRAINE DID NOT REPLY. AS SHE FOLLOWED HER UNCLE ACROSS THEWIDE OAKEN HALL SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT MANY WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO BETHE MISTRESS OF SUCH A FINE OLD HOUSE. WHAT BETTER POSITION COULD SHEDESIRE FOR ALDYTH THAN THAT WHICH SHE WOULD WIN IF SHE MARRIED HERCOUSIN THE HEIR OF WYNDHAM AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING REPUGNANT TOHER IN THE IDEA. GUY DID NOT SEEM TO HER TO POSSESS THE QUALITIES THATCOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD HUSBAND FOR ALDYTH.THEY WENT BACK INTO THE DINING ROOM. IT WAS A LARGE HANDSOME ROOM BUTITS DARK OAKEN FURNITURE DARK HANGINGS AND DARK CARPET MADE IT APPEARGLOOMY. THE WHOLE HOUSE INDEED HAD THE DINGY UNCAREDFOR LOOK THATA HOME GENERALLY GETS THAT HAS NO LADY AS ITS PRESIDING GENIUS. THEDRAWING ROOM A LONG NARROW ROOM FACING THE GARDEN WAS RARELY USED.OLD STEPHEN STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BLAZE SEATED HIMSELF IN HISARMCHAIR FOLDED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIM AND LOOKED DELIBERATELY AT HISNIECE.YOU DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA IT SEEMS BUT WHAT BETTER THING COULD THEREBE FOR ALDYTHTHAT DEPENDS ON HOW SHE WOULD REGARD IT SAID MISS LORRAINE DRILY.SHE HAS NO FORTUNE HE CONTINUED WITHOUT HEEDING HIS NIECES WORDS.HER MOTHER HAS GIVEN HER UP BUT IF SHE HAD NOT DONE SO SHE HASNOTHING TO LEAVE HER DAUGHTER.ALDYTH WILL NOT BE PENNILESS SAID HER AUNT QUIETLY. ALL THAT IHAVE TO LEAVE WILL BE HERS WHEN I AM NO MORE.STEPHEN LORRAINE MADE NO COMMENT ON THIS STATEMENT. EVIDENTLY HETHOUGHT THE  A YEAR MISS LORRAINE HAD INHERITED FROM HER FATHER APOOR THING IN COMPARISON WITH THE JOINT POSSESSION OF WYNDHAM AND THEFORTUNE HE HAD ACCUMULATED.IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MISS LORRAINE WITH SUDDEN BOLDNESS IT SEEMSTO ME A DANGEROUS THING TO MAKE PLANS OF THIS KIND. IF THE TWO AREDRAWN TO EACH OTHER ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT YOU CANNOT BE SURE THATALDYTH WOULD BE GUYS CHOICE OR SUPPOSING IT WERE SO THAT SHE COULDLOVE HIM.NONSENSE SAID THE OLD MAN SHARPLY. I TELL YOU SHE DOES LOVE HIM.SHELL BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU DO NOT STUFF HER HEAD WITH RUBBISH. WHATSALL THIS ABOUT THE LITERATURE LECTURES WHOS THAT YOUNG FELLOW THEYTELL ME IS CONSTANTLY AT YOUR HOUSEMISS LORRAINE COLOURED.OH TABITHA RUDKIN SHE SAID WITHIN HERSELF. THIS IS YOUR DOING.BUT SHE REPLIED CALMLYI SUPPOSE YOU MEAN MR. GLYNNE THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS GIVING THELECTURES. HE IS NOT MORE OFTEN AT MY HOUSE THAN HE IS AT OTHERPEOPLES.

I AM FOND OF GUY SAID ALDYTHINNOCENTLY BUT I CANNOT HELP WISHING HE WERE RATHER DIFFERENT. I DONOT THINK HE IS THE ONE FOR HILDA.HOW ABOUT YOURSELF THOUGHT MISS LORRAINE. AND SHE SIGHED FEELINGOPPRESSED BY A SENSE OF COMING TROUBLES WHICH SHE HAD NO POWER TOAVERT.ALDYTH WAS BUSY ARRANGING IN A VASE SOME FLOWERS SHE HAD BROUGHT FROMWYNDHAM. SHE LOOKED SO HAPPY AS SHE BENT OVER THEM HER LONG SLENDERFINGERS GIVING A TOUCH TO THIS STALK OR A PULL TO THAT LEAF TILL SHEHAD GOT JUST THE EFFECT SHE DESIRED THAT MISS LORRAINE SHRANK MORETHAN EVER FROM THE TASK OF COMMUNICATING UNCLE STEPHENS WISH. BUT ITHAD TO BE DONE.ALDYTH SHE SAID AT LAST YOU WILL BE DREADFULLY VEXED AT WHAT IHAVE TO TELL YOU BUT ITS NOT MY FAULT. YOUR UNCLE HAS TAKEN A STRONGDISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF THESE LECTURES AND HE WANTS YOU TO GIVE THEMUP.TO GIVE THEM UP EXCLAIMED ALDYTH FLUSHING DEEPLY IN HER SURPRISE.TO GIVE UP THE LITERATURE LECTURES BECAUSE HE DISLIKES THEM THAT ISMOST UNREASONABLE.SO I THINK SAID MISS LORRAINE BUT IT WAS NO USE TALKING TO UNCLE.HE THINKS THE ONLY KNOWLEDGE DESIRABLE FOR GIRLS IS HOW TO MAKEPUDDINGS AND KEEP A HOUSE IN GOOD ORDER. AND SHE REPEATED WHAT STEPHENLORRAINE HAD SAID ABOUT POETRY.ALDYTH WAS TOO HURT TO FIND AMUSEMENT IN HIS WORDS AS UNDER OTHERCIRCUMSTANCES SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE.AND HE ASKED YOU TO TELL ME THAT HE WISHES ME TO GIVE UP THE LECTURESHER AUNT NODDED.I CANNOT SEE THAT HE HAS ANY RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT I SHALL YIELD TO HISWISH IN THIS MATTER SAID ALDYTH DECIDEDLY. IT IS NOT AS IF HE HADANY GOOD REASON TO GIVE. WHY HE WISHES IT I CANNOT IMAGINE.MISS LORRAINE COULD UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL BUT SHE WAS NOT GOING TOENLIGHTEN HER NIECE.I DO NOT CARE SAID ALDYTH GIVING HER HEAD A LITTLE TOSS I SHALLNOT GIVE UP THE LECTURES. YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO AUNTMY DEAR IT WOULD BE VERY HARD BUT IT IS NOT WISE YOU KNOW TO CROSSYOUR UNCLES WILL.ALDYTHS FACE SAID PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT CARE WHETHER IT WERE WISEOR NOT. SHE ROSE TO BID HER AUNT GOODNIGHT. ALL THE BRIGHTNESS HADGONE FROM HER MANNER.MISS LORRAINE KISSED HER WITH MORE WARMTH THAN USUAL.I AM AS SORRY AS I CAN BE SHE SAID. I FELT QUITE ANGRY WITH UNCLE.IT IS A GREAT PITY FOR MR. GLYNNES LECTURES ARE SO GOOD AND YOU ENJOYTHEM SO MUCH.BUT I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM UP SAID ALDYTH. YOU NEED NOT SPEAKAS IF I WERE.SHE WENT HASTILY FROM THE ROOM THAT HER AUNT MIGHT NOT SEE THE TEARSTHAT HAD RISEN IN HER EYES. WHETHER SHE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THELECTURES OR NOT SHE FELT THAT HER ENJOYMENT OF THEM WAS SPOILED.AS SHE ENTERED HER ROOM THE SIGHT OF HER WRITINGTABLE REMINDED HEROF THE ESSAY SHE HAD MEANT TO FINISH ON THE MORROW. WOULD IT EVER BEFINISHED NOW OH SHE WISHED SHE HAD NOT GONE TO WYNDHAM THE THOUGHTOF HER UNCLES KINDNESS IN GIVING HER THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE GREW BITTERTO HER. SINCE HE HAD DONE SO MUCH TO GIVE HER PLEASURE HAD HE NOT ARIGHT TO EXPECT THAT SHE WOULD DO AS HE DESIREDYES IN HER SECRET HEART ALDYTH KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT ADHERE TOHER RESOLVE AND DEFY HER UNCLES ANGER. SHE KNEW IT BUT IT CAME HOMETO HER FORCIBLY AS SHE GLANCED AT HER MOTHERS PORTRAIT. IT WAS HERMOTHERS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD PLEASE HER UNCLE. THIS WAS THE MOSTSEVERE TEST TO WHICH ALDYTHS LOVE FOR THE MOTHER SHE DID NOT KNOW HADEVER BEEN PUT. HER LIPS QUIVERED AS SHE LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL FACEAND THE TEARS WHICH HAD BEEN SLOWLY GATHERING BEGAN TO FALL FAST. AHSHE WAS LEARNING SOMETHING NOW OF THE INEXORABLE DEMANDS OF DUTY SHETURNED AWAY SOBBING TO HERSELFIF ONLY I COULD TELL HER ALL ABOUT ITIF WE COULD TALK IT OVER TOGETHER SHE WOULD UNDERSTAND SHE WOULD HELPME.BUT ALDYTH NEEDED NO FURTHER INCENTIVE. HER LOVE HAD STOOD THE TEST.THE VOICE OF DUTY HAD NOT SPOKEN IN VAIN.SHE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING LOOKING LANGUID ANDHEAVYEYED. AUNTIE SHE SAID DIRECTLY THEY HAD GREETED EACH OTHERI SPOKE TOO HASTILY LAST NIGHT. I WAS ANGRY BUT IT IS OF NO USE TO BEANGRY I SHALL HAVE TO SUBMIT. MOTHER WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO DO ANYTHINGTHAT WOULD VEX UNCLE.NO SHE WOULD NOT SAID MISS LORRAINE. SHE THINKS IT OF GREATIMPORTANCE THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP IN FAVOUR WITH YOUR UNCLE. YOU AREACTING IN THE WAY SHE WOULD WISH BUT I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU MY DEARCHILD. I KNOW IT IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.ALDYTH WAS SILENT. SHE DID NOT CARE TO TALK ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT.WHAT TO MANY GIRLS WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT A TRIFLING SACRIFICE OFINCLINATION WAS TO HER WITH HER KEEN INTELLECTUAL TASTES A VERYGREAT LOSS.I SUPPOSE UNCLE WOULD LIKE ME TO GIVE UP THE LECTURES ALSO SAID MISSLORRAINE WITH A LITTLE LAUGH BUT HAPPILY HE DID NOT SUGGEST SUCH ATHING FOR I AM TOO DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THE UNDERTAKING TO ABANDON ITNOW. I EXPECT HE OWES ME A GRUDGE FOR STARTING THE IDEA.I THINK YOU MAY ATTEND THEM WITH SAFETY SAID ALDYTH MAKING ANEFFORT TO SPEAK LIGHTLY. THERE IS LITTLE FEAR THAT THE STUDY OF POETRYWILL UNFIT YOU FOR PRACTICAL LIFE RENDER YOU INCAPABLE OF MAKING APUDDING FOR INSTANCE IF COOK SHOULD FALL ILL.MISS LORRAINE LAUGHED. MEN ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO COOKERY SHESAID. PERHAPS IF MR. GLYNNE WERE LECTURING ON THAT SUBJECT UNCLEWOULD NOT OBJECT TO YOUR ATTENDING THE LECTURES.AN HOUR LATER KITTY AND HILDA BLAND CAME IN.HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR ESSAY ALDYTH HILDA ASKED.NO REPLIED ALDYTH.NO YOU ARE BEHINDHAND.

HE DOESNOT APPROVE OF THE LECTURES HE HAS DESIRED ME TO GIVE THEM UP.I AM SURE I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THE LECTURES IF I CARED FOR THEM AS YOUDO ALDYTH FOR ANY CROSSGRAINED OLD UNCLE IN THE WORLD SAID KITTYWARMLY. I CALL MR. LORRAINE A THOROUGH TYRANT.IT IS NOT FOR HIS SAKE SO MUCH AS FOR MY MOTHERS SAID ALDYTH. SHEWOULD NOT LIKE ME TO VEX UNCLE.I AM AFRAID I SHOULD NOT RESPECT MY MOTHERS WISHES IF SHE WERE ALLTHOSE MILES AWAY REMARKED HILDA. YOU MIGHT WRITE AND ASK HER ABOUTIT AND BY THE TIME YOU GOT HER REPLY THE LECTURES WOULD BE OVER.ALDYTH SMILED. NONSENSE HILDA SHE SAID YOU WOULD NOT DO SO IF YOUWERE IN MY PLACE.BUT YOU COULD WRITE THE ESSAYS AND SEND THEM TO MR. GLYNNE IF YOU DIDNOT ATTEND THE LECTURES SAID HILDA. YOU SHALL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF MYNOTES. COME YOU MIGHT DO THAT ALDYTH.ALDYTH SHOOK HER HEAD. IT WOULD NOT BE STRAIGHTFORWARD SHE SAID. ITWOULD BE OBEYING UNCLE IN THE LETTER BUT NOT IN SPIRIT. AND I OUGHT TOTREAT HIM BETTER THAN THAT FOR HE IS VERY GOOD TO ME. DO YOU KNOW HEHAS BOUGHT A BEAUTIFUL CHESTNUT MARE ON PURPOSE FOR ME TO RIDEYOU DONT MEAN IT EXCLAIMED KITTY. WELL YOU ARE A LUCKY GIRLALDYTH. I WOULD GLADLY GIVE UP THE LECTURES IF ANY ONE WOULD GIVE MEA HORSEWOULD NOT YOU HILDA OH I FORGOT YOU ARE SUCH A GOOSE ONHORSEBACK.HILDA MUST CONQUER HER FEARS SAID ALDYTH SMILING FOR GUY HAS SETHIS HEART ON OUR MAKING A RIDING PARTY ONE OF THESE DAYS AND HILDA ISTO RIDE BROWN BESS.HILDAS FACE FLUSHED WITH PLEASURE. OH I AM NOT SO NERVOUS AS IUSED TO BE SHE SAID QUICKLY AND BROWN BESS IS SUCH A STEADY OLDCREATURE. IT IS VERY KIND OF GUY TO THINK OF IT. HE IS KIND.

I AM AFRAID AUNTSMEMORY IS NOT VERY TRUSTWORTHY WHERE LITERATURE IS CONCERNED.I WONDER WHAT MR. GLYNNE WILL THINK OF YOUR KEEPING AWAY SAID KITTY.ALDYTH WINCED AT THE REMARK. IT WAS A THOUGHT WHICH HAD OCCURRED TO HERMANY TIMES ALREADY.NEVER MIND SAID KITTY GOODHUMOUREDLY AS SHE READ HER FACE IF IHAVE A CHANCE I WILL LET HIM KNOW THAT ITS NOT YOUR FAULT.CHAPTER VII.A MISCHIEFMAKER.ALDYTH WAS FEELING MORE OUT OF TEMPER THAN PERHAPS SHE HAD EVERFELT BEFORE. IT WAS THURSDAY EVENING AND MISS LORRAINE HAD GONE TOTHE LECTURE LEAVING HER ALONE. SHE HAD YIELDED TO HER UNCLES WISHFROM A SENSE OF DUTY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL RESIGNED TO THEDEPRIVATION HIS ABSURD CROTCHET WAS CAUSING HER. THE ABSURDITY THEUNREASONABLENESS OF IT STRUCK ALDYTH MORE AND MORE AS SHE SAT DISMALLYPICTURING KITTY AND HILDA AND HER OTHER FRIENDS ENJOYING THE LECTUREFROM WHICH SHE WAS SHUT OUT. SHE COULD SETTLE TO NO OCCUPATION. ITWAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL HER FORMER INTEREST IN THE COURSE OF READINGPRESCRIBED BY THE LECTURER. NEEDLEWORK WAS STILL MORE DISTASTEFUL. SHEBEGAN A LETTER TO HER SISTER GLADYS THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF WHOMHER MOTHER WROTE WITH PRIDE THAT SHE WAS CREATING QUITE A SENSATIONIN MELBOURNE SOCIETY BUT ALDYTH DROPPED HER PEN IN THE MIDDLE OF ASENTENCE AND SPRINGING UP BEGAN TO POKE THE FIRE WITH FAR MOREVIGOUR THAN ITS CONDITION DEMANDED. IT WAS OF NO USE TRYING TO THINK OFANYTHING EXCEPT THE LECTURE FROM WHICH SHE WAS SO PROVOKINGLY EXCLUDED.WOULD MR. GLYNNE OBSERVE HER ABSENCE SHE WONDERED WITH A LITTLE SIGH.   GIVE UNTO ME MADE LOWLY WISE    THE SPIRIT OF SELFSACRIFICE.WHAT BROUGHT THE WORDS TO HER MIND AT THAT MOMENT TRULY SHE HAD LITTLEOF THE SPIRIT OF SELFSACRIFICE. PERHAPS IT WAS WELL THAT HER WILL FORONCE SHOULD BE THWARTED THAT SHE MIGHT LEARN TO SACRIFICE HER OWNWISHES WITHOUT MURMURING. JOHN GLYNNE HAD BEEN WISE WHEN HE REMINDEDHER THAT DUTY WOULD NOT ALWAYS WEAR A SMILE UPON HER FACE. HE WAS ONETO OBEY DUTY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT A MURMUR. HE WAS A STRONGMAN. SHE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY THAT HE HAD ALREADY SACRIFICED HIS OWNINCLINATIONS MANY TIMES FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MOTHER. WOULD HE WITH HISRARE ABILITIES HAVE TAKEN SUCH A POST AS THAT HE HELD IN THE WOODHAMGRAMMAR SCHOOL HAD HE NOT BEEN ANXIOUS BY MEANS OF HIS SALARY TOINCREASE THE COMFORT OF HIS MOTHERS LIFEALDYTH FELT ASHAMED OF HERSELF AS SHE THOUGHT OF ONE SO MUCH NOBLER.SHE TURNED TO THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO PRACTISE DILIGENTLY A DIFFICULTPASSAGE IN A SONATA BUT HER THOUGHTS WERE AT THE LECTURE THE WHILE.THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE. AUNT LUCY SHOULD RETURN SOON BUT SHE WAS ONEOF THOSE PERSONS ON WHOSE PUNCTUAL RETURN TO THEIR HOMES IT IS NEVERPOSSIBLE TO DEPEND. SHE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO EVERYBODYWHEN THE LECTURE WAS OVER AND VARIOUS THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN TO DETAINHER.THE NEAT LITTLE HOUSEMAIDMISS LORRAINE WAS FAMOUS TRAINING YOUNGHOUSEMAIDS WHOM WHEN THEIR EDUCATION WAS COMPLETED SHE PASSED ON TOHER FRIENDSCAME TO LAY THE SUPPER FULL OF WONDER WHY MISS ALDYTH HADREMAINED AT HOME INSTEAD OF GOING OUT WITH HER AUNT AS SHE USUALLY DIDON THURSDAY EVENINGS. JUST THEN THE DOORBELL RANG. SARAH HASTENED TOOPEN THE DOOR AND RETURNING USHERED INTO THE ROOM MR. GLYNNE.ALDYTH WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE COLOURED DEEPLY AS SHEADVANCED TO WELCOME THE VISITOR. HE WAS LAST PERSON SHE EXPECTED TO SEEAT THAT HOUR. HE TOO SEEMED SURPRISED TO FIND HER THERE ALONE HAVINGEVIDENTLY PASSED THE EVENING IN SOLITUDE.GOOD EVENING MISS ALDYTH HE SAID REGARDING HER WITH GRAVESEARCHING EYES. HAVE I ARRIVED BEFORE MISS LORRAINE I THOUGHT ISHOULD OVERTAKE HER. SHE HAD LEFT THE HALL WHEN I CAME AWAY.PERHAPS SHE WENT INTO MRS. BLANDS SAID ALDYTH. IT IS NEVER CERTAINTHAT AUNT WILL COME STRAIGHT HOME. BUT SHE WILL BE IN DIRECTLY NODOUBT IF YOU WISH TO SEE HER.OH I WAS ONLY GOING TO ASK HER KINDLY TO GIVE YOU THIS HE REPLIEDPRODUCING FROM HIS COATPOCKET A SMALL RATHER ANCIENTLOOKING BOOKYOU SAID YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT.IT WAS A COPY OF THE FIRST EDITION OF THE LYRICAL BALLADS OF WHICH HEHAD BECOME POSSESSED. ALDYTH WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE IT BUT SHE FELTRATHER SHAMEFACED AS SHE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES.YOU WERE NOT AT THE LECTURE TONIGHT HE SAID A MINUTE LATER. THEREIS NOTHING AMISS I TRUSTI AM QUITE WELL IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN SHE REPLIED WITH NERVOUSQUICKNESS. I AM VERY SORRY MR. GLYNNE IT IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENTTO ME I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND ANY MORE OF THE LECTURES.INDEED HE SAID SURPRISED IN LOOK AND TONE.YES SAID ALDYTH COLOURING DEEPLY. IT IS NOT MY FAULT. I CANNOTHELP MYSELF IN THE MATTER. IT IS UNCLEHE THINKS IT IS NOT GOOD FORGIRLS TO STUDY POETRY. HE THINKS WE SHOULD DEVOTE OURSELVES ENTIRELY TOCOOKING AND HOUSEKEEPING.WHAT A BARBARIAN HE EXCLAIMED SO SERIOUSLY THAT ALDYTH BURST INTO ALAUGH AND ALL HER DISCONTENT SEEMED TO MELT AWAY.EXCUSE ME HE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT. I OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK SO OFYOUR UNCLE. BUT ARE YOU OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE STUDY OF POETRY BECAUSEHE THINKS IN THAT WAYYES SAID ALDYTH FIRMLY AT LEAST I FEEL THAT I MUST GIVE UP THELECTURES. IT WILL SEEM STRANGE TO YOU BUT THERE ARE REASONS WHY I AMPECULIARLY BOUND TO DEFER TO UNCLE STEPHENS WISHES.IS IT SO WELL I AM VERY SORRY HE SAID WITH SINCERE REGRET IN HISTONES. YOUR PAPERS WERE SO GOOD. MISS HILDA BLAND TOOK CHARGE OF THEONE I RETURNED THIS EVENING. IT IS MARKED EXCELLENT LIKE THE OTHERS.ALDYTHS FACE GLOWED WITH PLEASURE.AND NOW I SUPPOSE I MUST EXPECT NO MORE PAPERS FROM YOU HE ADDEDIN A TONE OF VEXATION.ALDYTH HESITATED AS SHE THOUGHT OF HILDAS SUGGESTION. IT WOULD HAVEBEEN SO EASY TO ARRANGE STILL TO WRITE THE PAPERS. BUT AFTER A MOMENTSHE ANSWERED YES.HE OBSERVED HER CLOSELY FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEN HE SAIDWELL I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU STILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE LECTURESAND I SHALL HOPE TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES AND TALK THINGS OVER. BUT I WISHVERY MUCH THAT YOUR UNCLE WEREDIFFERENT.THERE WAS SOMETHING SO DROLL IN THE WAY HE UTTERED THE LAST WORD THATALDYTH LAUGHED. SHE WAS FEELING VERY HAPPY JUST THEN DESPITE HERUNCLES PROHIBITION. ERE HER LAUGH WAS OVER MISS LORRAINE CAME IN ANDWAS SURPRISED AND PERHAPS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASED TO FIND THE LECTURERENTERTAINING HER NIECE. IT WAS NOT THAT HER LIKING FOR JOHN GLYNNE HADDIMINISHED BUT SHE HAD AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER UNCLE WOULDSTRONGLY OBJECT TO MR. GLYNNES BEING THERE ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS.YET MISS LORRAINES HOSPITABLE FEELINGS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TOREFRAIN FROM ASKING THE YOUNG MAN TO REMAIN AND TAKE SUPPER WITH THEM.THE INVITATION WAS GIVEN SO CORDIALLY THAT JOHN GLYNNE ACCEPTED ITWITHOUT HESITATION AND ALDYTH ENJOYED A TALK WITH HIM WHICH SHE TOLDHERSELF AFTERWARDS WAS AS GOOD AS HEARING THE LECTURE.HOW CLARA DAWTREY KNEW THAT JOHN GLYNNE SUPPED WITH THE LORRAINESTHAT NIGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY. BUT BY SOME SPECIES OFESPIONAGE SHE DISCOVERED THE FACT AND REPORTED IT TO HER AUNT TABITHA.CLARAS POWERS OF OBSERVATION WERE ON THE ALERT WHERE JOHN GLYNNE WASCONCERNED. SHE HAD SET HER HEART ON FASCINATING HIM AND PURSUED HEREND WITH AN UNMAIDENLY FREEDOM OF ACTION WHICH EXCITED DISGUST RATHERTHAN ADMIRATION IN THE MIND OF THAT GENTLEMAN.BUT VANITY RENDERED CLARA OBTUSE IN JUDGING THE EFFECT OF HERATTRACTIONS. MR. GLYNNES GRAVE POLITENESS DID NOT CHECK HER HOPESHIS QUIET RESERVED MANNER DID NOT RESTRAIN HER FROM ASKING QUESTIONSOR MAKING FLATTERING PERSONAL REMARKS WHICH HE FOUND PARTICULARLYDISAGREEABLE. CLARA HAD NOT A DOUBT THAT MR. GLYNNE WOULD FIND HERSOCIETY AS ATTRACTIVE IF NOT MORE SO AS THAT OF ALDYTH LORRAINE ANDTHE BLANDS IF ONLY SHE HAD MORE OPPORTUNITIES OF IMPRESSING HIM WITHHER WIT AND GAIETY AND THE CHARMS IN WHICH SHE SO CONFIDENTLY BELIEVED.SHE CERTAINLY LOST NO CHANCE OF BRINGING THESE TO BEAR ON HIM.SHE ALWAYS CONTRIVED TO SECURE A SEAT CLOSE TO THE PLATFORM AND TOSPEAK TO HIM AFTER EACH LECTURE COMPELLING HIM SOMETIMES WHENTHERE WERE STUDENTS WAITING TO CONSULT HIM TO BREAK AWAY FROM HERTRIVIALITIES WITH SCANT COURTESY. SHE MANAGED TO MEET HIM ALMOST EVERYDAY AS HE PASSED TO AND FRO BETWEEN HIS LODGINGS AND THE GRAMMARSCHOOL SHE QUESTIONED HIS LANDLADY CONCERNING HIS HABITS SHEFREQUENTED EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE WAS THE LEAST CHANCE OF SEEING HIM.IN SHORT SHE PURSUED HIM TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT JOHN GLYNNE BECAME ASANXIOUS TO AVOID HER AS SHE WAS TO MEET HIM.IT WAS A SORE VEXATION TO POOR CLARA DAWTREY TO SEE HOW QUICKLY JOHNGLYNNE FORMED A FRIENDSHIP WITH ALDYTH LORRAINE AND THE BLANDS WHILSTTOWARDS HER HIS MANNER CONTINUED ONLY DISTANTLY POLITE. HER DISLIKE FORTHESE GIRLS BECAME MORE BITTER. SHE HAD A MALICIOUS DESIRE TO ANNOY ORINJURE THEM IN REVENGE FOR THE INDIFFERENCE WITH WHICH THEY REGARDEDHER AND THE WAY IN WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO HER THEY MONOPOLIZED JOHNGLYNNE.ONE AFTERNOON CLARA DAWTREY WAS AT CARTMELLS THE STATIONERS ONEOF THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOPS IN THE HIGH STREET AND A GRAND CENTRE FORGOSSIP. THERE WAS A CIRCULATING LIBRARY IN CONNECTION WITH IT. CLARAHAD JUST OBTAINED A FRESH NOVEL AND WAS LEANING ON THE COUNTER IN EASYCONVERSATION WITH MR. CARTMELL WHEN SHE SAW JOHN GLYNNE GO PAST ON HISBICYCLE. IT WAS THE WEDNESDAY HALFHOLIDAY AND HE WAS OFF FOR A RUNIN THE COUNTRY. SHE SAW HIM TOO LATE FOR ANY CHANCE OF A GREETING ANDSHE WAS VEXED WITH HERSELF FOR LINGERING TO TALK WITH MR. CARTMELL ANDTHUS MISSING JOHN GLYNNE WHOM SHE MUST HAVE MET HAD SHE QUITTED THESHOP A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.SHE HURRIED OUT IN TIME TO SEE HIM GO RAPIDLY DOWN THE HILL ALMOSTAS FAR AS THE OLD CHURCH AND THEN TURN TO THE RIGHT. HE WAS GOINGDOWN THE HUNDREDS AS THE FLAT UNINTERESTING DISTRICT LYING TO THEEAST OF WOODHAM WAS TERMED THROUGH WHICH RAN A GOOD LEVEL ROAD.WELL HE COULD NOT BE GOING FAR IN THAT DIRECTION AND THE NOVEMBERAFTERNOON WAS SHORT. SHE MIGHT YET MANAGE TO MEET HIM AND GIVE HIM ANOPPORTUNITY OF ADMIRING HER APPEARANCE IN THE SMART LITTLE CRIMSON HATSHE HAD LATELY RECEIVED FROM LONDON.CLARAS FATHER WAS A SOLICITOR A MAN OF SOMEWHAT ILLREPUTE IN HISPROFESSION BUT WELLTODO AND CLARA HIS FAVOURITE DAUGHTER ANDTHE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED UNMARRIED HAD A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE FORHER PERSONAL EXPENSES. YET LARGE AS IT WAS HER DRESSMAKERS ANDMILLINERS BILLS OFTEN OUTRAN IT. CLARAS MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN SHE WASA CHILD A FACT ALDYTH ALWAYS REMEMBERED WHEN OTHERS WERE DISPOSED TOJUDGE CLARA HARSHLY. HER FATHER HAD NOT MARRIED AGAIN AND THE GIRLHAD GROWN UP WITH LITTLE CONTROL SAVE THAT OF SISTERS AS FLIGHTY ANDHEEDLESS AS HERSELF. IF SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF TO HAVE ANY DUTIESTHEY WERE SUCH AS MADE BUT THE SLIGHTEST DEMAND UPON HER TIME AND SHESEEMED TO HAVE NO IDEA OF ANY HIGHER AIM IN LIFE THAN THAT OF HER OWNGRATIFICATION. ALDYTH WAS PERHAPS RIGHT WHEN IN HER GENTLE CHARITYSHE SPOKE OF CLARA AS ONE TO BE PITIED RATHER THAN BLAMED.IT WAS A MILD NOVEMBER AFTERNOON. CLARA SAUNTERED SLOWLY DOWN THE HILLAND TURNING TO THE LEFT CAME ON TO THE BANK OF THE RIVER. IT WAS ATIDAL RIVER AND WHEN AS NOW IT WAS HIGH WATER THE RED ROOFS OF THEHOUSES AND THE BARGES ON THE RIVER WITH THEIR LARGE OCHRECOLOUREDSAILS GAVE TO THE LITTLE TOWN SOMEWHAT OF THE APPEARANCE OF A DUTCHVILLAGE. THE SKY WAS GREY BUT CLEAR AND THE SUBTLE MELANCHOLY CHARMOF AUTUMN PERVADED THE SCENE BUT CLARA WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ITSBEAUTY AS WAS ALDYTH WHO HAD JUST COME OUT OF ONE THE COTTAGES ONTHE SHORE AND STOOD GAZING UP THE RIVER. SO TRUE IS IT THAT THE EYEPERCEIVES BEAUTY ONLY AS THE MIND INSPIRES ITS VISION. CLARA LACKED THEIMAGINATION THAT CAN BEHOLD   A LIGHT THAT NEVER WAS ON SEA OR LAND.ILLUSTRATIONALDYTH HEARD A STEP ON THE SHINGLE BUT NOT TILL SHE TURNED RATHERSUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT SHE HAD SEVERAL COTTAGES TO VISIT THATAFTERNOON DID SHE SEE CLARA. THE GIRLS CAME FACE TO FACE WITHIN A FEWFEET OF EACH OTHER. ALDYTH MOVED BY WITH A BOW AND THE WORDSA LOVELY AFTERNOON IS IT NOTVERY RESPONDED CLARA COOLLY.SHE WAS ANNOYED THAT ALDYTH PASSED WITHOUT SAYING MORE.SHE NEED NOT AVOID ME AS IF I HAD THE PLAGUE SHE SAID TO HERSELF.SHE LOOKED AFTER ALDYTH WITH A DISLIKE THAT WAS BORN OF ENVY. ALDYTH INHER SIMPLE SERGE SUIT AND LITTLE FELT HAT LOOKED SUCH A LADY THAT FORA MOMENT CLARA HATED HER NEW ADORNMENTS AND FELT THAT THEY WERE GAUDYAND VULGAR.SHE WANDERED RATHER DREARILY BY THE RIVER. IN SUMMER WHEN BOATING WASGENERAL ITS BANKS PRESENTED A LIVELY SCENE BUT NOW THERE WERE FEWBOATS OUT THE SUNLIGHT HAD FADED AND A GREY MIST WAS BEGINNING TOGATHER OVER THE DISTANT MARSHES. CLARA HARDLY KNEW HOW TO FILL UP THETIME TILL SHE MIGHT EXPECT JOHN GLYNNE TO BE ON HIS WAY HOME. SHE WENTBACK INTO THE HIGH STREET AND MADE A LARGE PURCHASE OF SWEETMEATS ATTHE CHIEF CONFECTIONERS. THEN A THOUGHT STRUCK HER. A ROAD BRANCHEDOFF FROM THE HUNDREDS INTO THE LONGBRIDGE ROAD. MR. GLYNNE WOULD VERYLIKELY RETURN TO HIS LODGINGS BY THAT. HOW ANNOYING IF SHE MISSED HIMAFTER ALL THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO WALK AS FAR AS THE JUNCTIONOF THE TWO ROADS AND SHE STARTED AT ONCE MUCH FEARING SHE MIGHT BETOO LATE.SHE WALKED BRISKLY BUT ERE SHE HAD REACHED THE TURNING INTO THELONGBRIDGE ROAD SHE SAW THE INDIVIDUAL SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO MEET. COULDANYTHING BE MORE PROVOKING HE WAS NOT ONE. HE HAD ALIGHTED FROM HISBICYCLE AND WAS WALKING BY THE SIDE OF A LADY. COULD IT BEYESACTUALLYIT WASALDYTH LORRAINETHERE SHE WAS WALKING BY MR. GLYNNES SIDE ON THE QUIET COUNTRY ROADAND HE WAS TALKING SO EARNESTLY TO HER THAT DESPITE THE CRIMSONHAT CLARA HAD ALMOST PASSED ERE HE SAW HER AND THEN HE CLUTCHEDMECHANICALLY AT HIS CAP WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE ANY CLEAR NOTION TOWHOM HE WAS BOWING.ALDYTH HAD SEEN HER. CLARA FELT SURE THAT SHE COLOURED AS SHE MET HERGLANCE AND NO WONDER.CLARA WAS SCANDALIZED. THAT ALDYTH SHOULD BE WALKING WITH MR. GLYNNE INTHAT LONELY PART OF THE ROAD WAS SHOCKING TO HER THOUGH ASSUREDLY HADMR. GLYNNE OVERTAKEN HER WHEN SHE WAS THERE ALONE SHE WOULD NOT HAVEHESITATED TO WALK BACK TO WOODHAM WITH HIM.ALDYTH LORRAINE WHO WAS SO GOOD AND PROPER WHO WOULD BELIEVE ITOF COURSE IT WAS A PLANNED THING.

SHE MET ME THE OTHERDAY WALKING WITH MR. GLYNNE. THAT WAS FOUNDATION ENOUGH FOR THISFABRICATION. OH DEAR I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL HER WHAT I THINK OF IT.BUT IT WOULD DO NO GOOD.NO NO SAID MRS. BLAND. THE BEST WAY IS TO TAKE NO NOTICE AND LETTHE REPORT DIE A NATURAL DEATH.THE TALK TURNED TO OTHER MATTERS BUT MRS. BLAND COULD SEE THATTHROUGHOUT HER VISIT ALDYTHS MIND WAS DWELLING ON THE UNPLEASANT FACTSHE HAD LEARNED. MRS. BLAND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND INDIGNANT WITH CLARADAWTREY. SHE KNEW THAT NOTHING IS MORE TRYING FOR A GIRL NOTHING MOREPREJUDICIAL TO HER HAPPINESS THAN TO HAVE HER NAME THUS COUPLED WITHTHAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUES.TWO EVENINGS LATER KITTY CAME IN FROM ATTENDING A MEETING OF THEWOODHAM SEWING CLUB IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT.WHAT IS THE MATTER KITTY ASKED HER MOTHER FOR KITTYS FACE WASCRIMSON HER EYES SPARKLING AND SHE BURST INTO THE ROOM IN A WAY WHICHSHOWED NO RESPECT FOR THE NERVES OF THOSE WHO OCCUPIED IT.HILDA WHO HAD BEEN DREAMING RATHER THAN READING AS SHE SAT BY THEFIRE LOOKED UP WITH A STARTLED FACE.OH NOTHING SAID KITTY CALMING DOWN AS SHE SAW THE SURPRISE SHE WASCAUSING NOTHING EXCEPT THAT I HAVE HAD IT OUT WITH CLARA DAWTREYAND PREVENTED HER FROM TELLING ANY MORE STORIES ABOUT ALDYTH.KITTY EXCLAIMED HILDA.

MISS CLARA DID NOT MEAN ME TO HEARBUT I CAUGHT A WORD OR TWO AND I SPOKE OUT AT ONCE AND SAID THEREWAS NOT AN ATOM OF TRUTH IN THE REPORT THAT ALDYTH WAS ENGAGED TO MR.GLYNNE.

ANYHOW IVE KILLED THAT RUMOUR BUT I DARE SAY A FRESHONE WILL BE STARTED FOR MISS PHIPPS BEGAN TO SAY THAT SHE HAD ALWAYSUNDERSTOOD ALDYTH WAS TO MARRY HER COUSIN.POOR ALDYTH EXCLAIMED MRS. BLAND WHILST HILDA HASTILY TOOK UP HERBOOK TO HIDE THE HOT COLOUR THAT WAS MOUNTING IN HER CHEEKS. WHY WILLPEOPLE TALK ABOUT HER SOMOTHER DO YOU THINK THAT ALDYTH WILL MARRY GUY ASKED KITTY.MY DEAR HOW CAN I SAY WHOM SHE WILL MARRY I AM NO ORACLE. BUT I AMSURE THAT NOTHING WOULD BETTER PLEASE STEPHEN LORRAINE. AND IN MANYRESPECTS IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR ALDYTH.YES OF COURSE SAID KITTY IN A COMFORTABLE MATTEROFFACT TONESHE WOULD BE THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM SHE WOULD HAVE PLENTY OF MONEYAND COULD KEEP AS MANY HORSES AS SHE LIKED BUT STILL I CANNOT FANCYTHAT ALDYTH WOULD CARE TO MARRY GUY.KITTY QUITTED THE ROOM AS SHE SPOKE. HILDA BENT OVER HER BOOKAPPARENTLY ABSORBED IN ITS PAGES BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE UNWONTEDCOLOUR IN HER CHEEKS FADED.NEEDLESS TO SAY KITTYS ENCOUNTER WITH CLARA DAWTREY DID NOT TEND TOSOFTEN THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH THAT YOUNG LADY REGARDED THE BLANDS ANDTHEIR FRIEND.A FEW DAYS LATER CLARA WHO OCCASIONALLY CALLED ON MRS. GREENWOODALTHOUGH THE BANKERS WIFE DID NOT ADMIT HER INTO THE INNER CIRCLE OFHER FRIENDS ENTERED THAT LADYS DRAWING ROOM TO FIND JOHN GLYNNE THERETALKING TO HER. CLARA WAS DELIGHTED TO MEET HIM THUS AND IMMEDIATELYBEGAN TO DISPLAY ALL THE COQUETTISH AIRS AND GRACES BY WHICH SHEBELIEVED THAT SHE RENDERED HERSELF CHARMING TO GENTLEMEN.MR. GLYNNE WOULD HAVE RETIRED AFTER A FEW MINUTES BUT AS HE ROSE THESERVANT APPEARED CARRYING THE TEATRAY AND MRS. GREENWOOD WOULD NOTHEAR OF HIS GOING BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A CUP OF TEA. JUST THEN OTHERVISITORS WERE ANNOUNCED WHO ENGAGED MRS. GREENWOODS ATTENTION ANDGLYNNE FOUND HIMSELF DRAWN INTO A TALK WITH MISS DAWTREY. THEY WERESEATED WITHIN THE BOWWINDOW WHICH COMMANDED THE HIGH STREET.CLARA TALKING RAPIDLY LOOKED UP AT HER COMPANION WITH WHAT SHEBELIEVED TO BE AN ARCH GLANCE WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS PAYINGLITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE SAID. HIS EYES DID NOT MEET HERS THEYWERE LOOKING BEYOND HER DOWN INTO THE STREET. CLARA TURNED QUICKLY TOSEE WHAT WAS INTERESTING HIM THERE. HER CHAGRIN DID NOT LESSEN WHEN SHESAW THAT ALDYTH LORRAINE WAS RIDING PAST ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUSIN.THE GIRLRIDER LOOKED TRIM AND GRACEFUL IN HER DARK BLUE HABIT ANDLITTLE FELT HAT WITH WHITE PLUME.ALDYTH LORRAINE LOOKS WELL ON HORSEBACK REMARKED CLARA STUDYINGMR. GLYNNES COUNTENANCE WITH AN INTENTNESS OF WHICH HE BECAMEUNCOMFORTABLY AWARE. SOME PEOPLE CALL HER PRETTY. DO YOU THINK SHE ISPRETTYREALLY MISS DAWTREY THAT IS HARDLY A FAIR QUESTION HE REPLIEDLAUGHINGLY. IS NOT A GENTLEMAN BOUND TO ADMIRE EVERY YOUNG LADY HEMEETSOH THATS RUBBISH SHE SAID. YOU CANT ADMIRE UGLY GIRLS. NOWI CALL GUY LORRAINE A VERY HANDSOME FELLOW YOU DONT THINK SO OFCOURSE YOU MEN ARE SO JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER BUT HE IS. HE OUGHT TOHAVE A PRETTY WIFE. OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HIMSIGNIFICANTLY.PLEASE DO NOT TAKE MY KNOWLEDGE FOR GRANTED HE SAID HIS HEARTBEATING MORE QUICKLY AS HE SPOKE DO YOU MEAN THAT MISS ALDYTH WILLMARRY HER COUSINOH HUSH SHE SAID PUTTING HER FINGER TO HER LIPS WITH A WARNINGLOOK AND THEN GLANCING AT THE OTHER VISITORS. I WOULD NOT HAVE SAIDANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT I MADE SURE YOU KNEW.BUT SURELYIF THEY ARE ENGAGEDIS IT AN ENGAGEMENTTHAT IS AN AWKWARD QUESTION MR. GLYNNE SAID CLARA DROPPING HEREYES. I DO NOT WISH TO TELL YOU A STORY AND I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TOANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. THOUGH REALLY IT IS ABSURD TO MAKE A SECRETOF IT FOR EVERY ONE AT WOODHAM HAS KNOWN SINCE THEY WERE CHILDRENTHAT GUY AND ALDYTH WERE INTENDED FOR EACH OTHER. MY GREATAUNT MISSRUDKIN IS IN MR. STEPHEN LORRAINES CONFIDENCE AND HE HAS TOLD HERTHAT HE LOOKS FORWARD TO THEIR UNION. BUT PRAY DO NOT REPEAT WHAT IHAVE SAID I SHOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU.IT IS SAFE WITH ME HE SAID QUIETLY.HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AND COULD MAINTAIN AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE.THERE HAS BEEN AN ABSURD FUSS LATELY SAID CLARA IN A CAREFULLYSUBDUED TONE BECAUSE A RUMOUR AROSE THAT ALDYTH WAS ENGAGED TOANOTHER GENTLEMAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAS BEEN MOST INDIGNANT ABOUTIT AND THE BLANDS CALL IT A PREPOSTEROUS IDEA. ALDYTH IS VERY PROUDI SUPPOSE IT DOES NOT PLEASE HER THAT HER NAME SHOULD BE COUPLED WITHTHAT OF ANY ONE SAVE HER COUSIN.NATURALLY SAID JOHN GLYNNE RISING TO PUT DOWN HIS CUP. HIS TONE WASCOLD AND HARD. WITH ALL HIS SELFCONTROL HE COULD NOT HELP THE COLOURRISING IN HIS FACE AS MISS DAWTREY SPOKE.IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IN SUCH A PLACE AS WOODHAM HE SHOULD FAIL TOHEAR WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING ABOUT HIM AND MISS ALDYTH LORRAINE. ITHAD ANNOYED HIM ALMOST AS MUCH AS IT HAD ANNOYED HER BUT HIS VEXATIONWAS ENTIRELY ON HER ACCOUNT. HE COULD NOT BLAME HIMSELF HE HAD DONENOTHING THAT COULD GIVE COLOUR TO SUCH AN ASSERTION. HE WAS CERTAINTHAT CLARA DAWTREY MEANT TO ANNOY HIM BY HER WORDS. SHE COULD NOT HAVESUPPOSED THAT HE WAS UNAWARE THAT IT WAS HIS NAME THAT PEOPLE HADLINKED TO THAT OF ALDYTH. BUT FOR THAT HE CARED NOT. WHAT STUNG HIM INHER WORDS WAS THEIR SUGGESTION THAT SOME DISDAIN OF HIM HAD MINGLEDWITH ALDYTHS INDIGNATION. HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HASTILY AND WENT BACKTO HIS LODGINGS IN A DEPRESSED FRAME OF MIND.HIS LITTLE SITTING ROOM WITH ITS HARD HORSEHAIR FURNITURE ITSBRILLIANTLY COLOURED PICTURES ITS QUAINT DECORATIONS OF SEAWEED ANDSHELLS HAD NEVER SEEMED SO DISTASTEFUL AND UNHOMELIKE AS IT DIDTONIGHT. HIS LANDLADYS SHOES HAD NEVER CREAKED SO HORRIBLY AS WHENSHE WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE HIS EVENING MEAL THE CONVERSATIONALEFFORTS SHE MADE IN HER NASAL MONOTONE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRESOME.SO ALDYTH LORRAINE WAS TO MARRY HER COUSIN FOR HE DID NOT FOR AMOMENT IMAGINE THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN IN THE INFERENCE HE HAD DRAWN FROMMISS DAWTREYS WORDS. WELL IT WAS NOT SURPRISING AND YET HE WASSURPRISED. THEY WERE SO DIFFERENT. WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF GUY LORRAINEHAD LED HIM TO REGARD HIM WITH A SORT OF GOODNATURED CONTEMPT. A FINEHUMAN ANIMAL HE HAD THOUGHT HIM A CLEVER SPORTSMAN AND NOT WITHOUTGOOD QUALITIES BUT EMPTYHEADED AND PRIMED WITH THE SELFCONCEIT THATOFTEN ACCOMPANIES A VACANT MIND. ALDYTH LORRAINE WITH HER INTELLECTUALTASTES HER DELICATE PERCEPTIONS HER EXQUISITE REFINEMENT OF MIND TOSHARE THE LIFE OF SUCH A MAN WHAT HAD THEY IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIRHORSEMANSHIP AND THEIR LOVE OF OUTOFDOOR LIFEIN GUYS CASE IT COULDSCARCELY BE TERMED LOVE OF NATUREHAVING TAKEN HIS SUPPER HASTILY AND WITH LITTLE APPETITE GLYNNEPLUNGED INTO WORK AND TRIED TO BANISH THESE THOUGHTS FROM HIS MIND.AFTER ALL IT WAS NO CONCERN OF HIS WHOM ALDYTH MIGHT CHOOSE TO MARRY.AND YETAND YETONE THING HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR TO HIM BY THE TALK OFTHE GOSSIPSTHE FACT THAT HAD HE BEEN IN A POSITION TO CONTEMPLATEMARRIAGE ALDYTH WAS THE GIRL HE WOULD DESIRE TO WIN. WAS SHE MAKING AFREE CHOICE IN THE MATTER HE ASKED HIMSELF WITH A SUDDEN THRILL.HE REMEMBERED HOW SHE HAD SAID I AM PECULIARLY BOUND TO DEFER TOUNCLE STEPHENS WISHES. COULD IT BE THAT SHE WAS BEING FORCED INTOTHIS MARRIAGE NO IMPOSSIBLE SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MARRY UNDERCOMPULSION. THE WORDS MUST HAVE REFERRED TO HER ENGAGEMENT. THEY WERE ACONFIRMATION OF WHAT MISS DAWTREY HAD SAID. GLYNNES SPIRITS SANK LOWERAS HE THOUGHT THIS. VAINLY HE TRIED TO ABSORB HIMSELF IN HIS WORKTHOUGHTS OF ALDYTH WOULD COME BETWEEN HIM AND IT AND MINGLING WITHTHEM CAME TO MIND SCRAPS OF LOCKSLEY HALL.   HE WILL HOLD THEE WHEN HIS PASSION SHALL HAVE SPENT ITS NOVEL FORCE    SOMETHING BETTER THAN HIS DOG A LITTLE DEARER THAN HIS HORSE.CHAPTER IX.MR. STEPHEN LORRAINE COMES TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HIS HEIR.JOHN GLYNNE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED COULD HE HAVE KNOWN HOW LITTLEALDYTH HAD ENJOYED THAT RIDE WITH HER COUSIN. SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUSOF SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN GUYS MANNER TOWARDS HER. HE HAD BEEN MOREASSIDUOUS IN HIS ATTENTIONS TO HER THAN HE WAS WONT TO BE YET AT THESAME TIME HE HAD VEXED HER BY CONTEMPTUOUS ALLUSIONS TO JOHN GLYNNEAND THE REPORT THAT HAD BEEN CIRCULATED IN WOODHAM.IT HAD BECOME A SORE SUBJECT WITH ALDYTH AND SHE WAS FAR FROMAPPRECIATING THE WITTICISMS IN WHICH GUY INDULGED AT HER EXPENSE. YETGUY HAD NO INTENTION OF ANNOYING HER. ON THE CONTRARY HE MEANT TO TRYHIS BEST TO PLEASE HIS COUSIN. BUT IT WAS NOT EASY TO SUBSTITUTE FORTHE OLD FREE AND EASY COUSINLY INTERCOURSE THE NEW RLE HE HAD TAKENUPON HIMSELF. HE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN HIS ENDEAVOURS AND HE FELT THATHE HAD NOT.I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT AS I SHOULD HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HERODE BACK TO WYNDHAM AFTER LINGERING A WHILE IN THE HIGH STREET INTHE HOPE OF SEEING THE BLANDS. I WISH I HAD NOT PROMISED BUT WYNDHAMIS WORTH A SACRIFICE THOUGH IT IS HARD THAT A FELLOW MAY NOT CHOOSEHIS OWN WIFE. AND GUY FELT ANYTHING BUT COMFORTABLE AS HE SURVEYED THEPOSITION IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF.A FEW DAYS EARLIER STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD RIDDEN BACK FROM WOODHAM IN THEWORST OF HUMOURS. HE HAD NEVER ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO PUT ANY KIND OFRESTRAINT ON HIS IRRITABILITY AND HE HAD NO SOONER RETURNED THAN HISHOUSEHOLD HAD CAUSE TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING HAD PUT HIM OUT.GUY WHO CAME INTO DINNER A FEW MINUTES LATE RECEIVED HIS SHARE OF HISUNCLES WRATH.YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER SIR THAT MY DINNER HOUR IS SIX.IT IS DOUBTLESS DISAGREEABLE TO YOU TO CONFORM TO MY HABITS BUT ITCANNOT BE FOR LONG NOW AND I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT YOUWILL PAY ME THAT DEGREE OF RESPECT.HAPPILY GUY WHO WAS TOLERABLY EASY OF TEMPER DID NOT ENCOURAGE HISUNCLES QUARRELSOME TENDENCY.I AM SORRY TO BE LATE UNCLE HE SAID. I ASSURE YOU I LIKE MY DINNERAT SIX BUT THAT FELLOW AMES DETAINED ME. IS THERE ANY SOUP COMING FORMEI BELIEVE SO BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR THROAT YOUWILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT SAID THE OLD MAN GRIMLY.

HOW DID YOU FIND THINGS ATWOODHAM MUCH AS USUAL I SUPPOSEAN IMPATIENT SOUND ESCAPED OLD STEPHENS LIPS BUT HE SAID NOTHINGAND GUY DID NOT PURSUE THE INQUIRY THOUGH HE WAS FULL OF WONDER AS TOTHE CAUSE OF HIS UNCLES ILLTEMPER. THE FEW CAREFULLYCHOSEN REMARKSON WHICH HE VENTURED BEING UNGRACIOUSLY RECEIVED GUY FINISHED HISDINNER IN SILENCE. AS THE DESSERT WAS PLACED ON THE TABLE THE OLDMANS MANNER BRIGHTENED SOMEWHAT. HE SENT FOR A BOTTLE OF SPECIAL PORTFROM THE CELLAR AND HAVING FILLED HIS OWN GLASS PUSHED THE BLACKCOBWEBBED BOTTLE TOWARDS GUY.FILL UP YOULL FIND IT WORTH DRINKING HE SAID. ITS ALMOST AS GOODAS THE  WILL PROVE I TRUST WHICH I AM KEEPING FOR YOUR WEDDING.GUY LAUGHED AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS.TIME ENOUGH TO THINK OF THAT SIR HE SAID LIGHTLY.NAY NOT SO SAID THE OLD MAN WITH REPRESSED EAGERNESS IT IS TIMEYOU BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT SERIOUSLY MY LAD IF I AM TO HAVE THEPLEASURE OF DRINKING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRETTY BRIDE.GUY COLOURED AND FELL TO STUDYING HIS WINEGLASS TO HIDE HISEMBARRASSMENT.I SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT SEE MY WEDDING SIRHE REPLIED WITH BECOMING SERIOUSNESS BUT HAPPILY YOU ARE A RARE MANFOR YOUR YEARS AND WILL I TRUST SEE MANY MORE FOR I AM BUT A YOUNGFELLOW TO THINK OF MARRYING.NONSENSE SAID THE OLD MAN SHARPLY YOU ARE TWENTYFOUR AND INYOUR CASE THERE IS NO REASON WHY MARRIAGE SHOULD BE DELAYED. NOW DONOT SMILE GUY IF YOU PLEASE. I AM IN EARNEST AND I WISH YOU TO BE.CERTAINLY UNCLE I WILL CONSIDER WHAT YOU SAY BUT A FELLOW CANHARDLY GET MARRIED AT A MOMENTS NOTICE.PSHAW HOW YOU TALK CRIED OLD STEPHEN IMPATIENTLY.

GLYNNE YOU MEAN. WELL WHY SHOULD NOT ALDYTH MARRY HIM IF SHEFANCIES HIMGUY ARE YOU BESIDE YOURSELF DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HOWDARE YOU SUGGEST THAT SUCH A MARRIAGE WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR ALDYTHA BEGGARLY USHERA FELLOW OF NO SOCIAL POSITION WHATEVER WOULD YOUTAMELY SUBMIT TO SEE HER THROW HERSELF AWAY UPON SUCH AN ONETHERE WAS GROWING PASSION IN THE OLD MANS TONES. GUY WAS ALARMED BUTHE TOOK REFUGE IN SULKY INDIFFERENCE.I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY TAMELY SUBMITTING TO IT. OF COURSE ITWOULD BE A PITY. I SHOULD NOT ADMIRE ALDYTHS TASTE BUT I COULD NOTINTERFERE IN THE MATTER.IT IS ABSURD FOR YOU TO AFFECT TO MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID STEPHENLORRAINE GROWING MORE ANGRY. YOU MUST KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVEALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO YOUR MARRYING ALDYTH.INDEED SIR SAID GUY LOOKING BLANK. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOUHAVE ACQUAINTED ME WITH THE FACT.YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED INFORMATION. YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT WAS THEONLY THING TO BE THOUGHT OF.BUT I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT SAID GUY AND I MUST CONFESS THAT IDO NOT LIKE THE IDEA. ALDYTH IS MY COUSIN.YOUR SECOND COUSIN SAID HIS UNCLE.SECOND OR FIRST SAID GUY IT IS THE SAME. WE HAVE GROWN UP TOGETHERALMOST LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER. I AM FOND OF ALDYTH BUT I TELL YOUHONESTLY SIR I HAVE NO WISH TO MAKE HER MY WIFE.YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS TO YOUR INTEREST TO DO SO SAID HIS UNCLEWITH A CALMNESS BORN OF INTENSE PASSION. LISTEN TO ME SIR. ALDYTHIS EVERY WHIT AS DEAR TO ME AS YOU ARE. WHEN I HAVE LOOKED ON YOU ASTHE HEIR TO WYNDHAM IT HAS BEEN WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD SHAREYOUR INHERITANCE. I DO NOT CHOOSE TO DIVIDE MY PROPERTY BETWEEN YOUBUT NEITHER DO I MEAN THAT ALDYTH SHOULD SUFFER LOSS. IF YOU RESOLVETO DISREGARD MY WISH IN THIS MATTER I SHALL HAVE TO RECONSIDER THEDISPOSITION OF MY PROPERTY. NOW I HAVE GIVEN YOU FAIR WARNING.GUY HEARD HIS UNCLE WITH FEELINGS OF THE UTMOST DISMAY. I DONT KNOWABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THE MATTER HE MUTTERED THEN ADDED IN A LOUDERTONE YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THIS HAS COME UPON ME VERY SUDDENLY. IT ISHARD FOR A MAN TO HAVE IT DICTATED TO HIM WHOM HE IS TO MARRY.NOT AT ALL INTERRUPTED HIS UNCLE WHEN THE GIRL IS SUCH A FAIRSWEET GIRL AS ALDYTH.I DONT BELIEVE SHE WILL HAVE ME SAID GUY WITH THE AIR OF HAVINGHIT UPON A HAPPY SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY. YOU WILL NOT BLAME MEUNCLE IF SHE REFUSES MEYES I SHALL RETURNED OLD STEPHEN GRIMLY. IF SHE REFUSES IT WILLBE BECAUSE YOU HAVE WOOED HER IN A SORRY FASHION. YOU ASK HER PROPERLYAND TELL HER THAT I WISH IT AND SHE WILL HAVE YOU FAST ENOUGH.GUY DEVOUTLY HOPED THAT HIS UNCLE MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN THIS BELIEF. BUTHE LACKED THE COURAGE TO WITHSTAND HIM AND BOLDLY CLAIM HIS RIGHT TOACT AS HE WOULD IN A MATTER THAT SO CLOSELY CONCERNED HIS HAPPINESS.GUY BELIEVED THAT HILDA BLAND WAS THE GIRL WHO COULD MAKE HIM HAPPYBUT HE WAS NOT ONE TO DEEM THE WORLD WELL LOST FOR LOVE. THE HEIRSHIPOF WYNDHAM WAS DEAR TO HIM. NOT FOR ANY GIRLS SAKE COULD HE BEAR TOBE DISINHERITED. SO HE TEMPORIZED AND DRIFTED INTO A SORT OF TACITPROMISE THAT HE WOULD SEEK TO WIN ALDYTH FOR HIS WIFE.IT WAS WITH POOR SPIRITS THAT GUY SET HIMSELF TO CARRY OUT HIS PURPOSE.HE HAD LITTLE HOPE THAT ALDYTH WOULD REALLY REFUSE HIS BRILLIANT OFFER.A WOMAN HE TOLD HIMSELF IN HIS YOUTHFUL WISDOM REGARDS MARRIAGE FROMA VERY DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW FROM THAT OF A MAN. WAS IT LIKELY THATONE WHOSE MATRIMONIAL CHANCES WERE SO LIMITED AND UNCERTAIN WOULDREJECT IN ONE BREATH HIMSELF AND WYNDHAMBUT SOMEHOW GUY WAS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACT THEPART OF A LOVER. HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE ALDYTH OF HISSINCERITY. SHE WOULD TAKE PURELY AS A JOKE HIS PRETTY SPEECHES AND THEDEVOTED AIRS HE TRIED TO ASSUME. SHE LAUGHED AT HIM AND BANTERED HIMON WHAT SHE BELIEVED TO BE MERE AFFECTATIONS. THE CHIEF RESULT OF HISENDEAVOURS WAS TO RAISE DOUBT AND JEALOUSY IN THE MIND OF HILDA BLANDTOWARDS WHOM HIS FRIENDLINESS WAS MARKED BY STRANGE FLUCTUATIONS ANDWHO WAS QUICK TO PERCEIVE THAT GUY WAS MORE ATTENTIVE TO HIS COUSINTHAN HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN. ONE DAY HE WOULD TREAT HILDA WITH SUCHAPPARENT INDIFFERENCE THAT HER THOUGHTS WOULD TURN WITH SYMPATHY TOMARIANA IN THE MOATED GRANGE AND SHE WOULD DREAM OF DYING EARLY OFA BROKEN HEART THEN AGAIN HE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE BETRAYED INTO THEOLD TENDERNESS OF VOICE AND LOOK AND HILDAS HEART WOULD BEAT WITHTUMULTUOUS DELIGHT AND LIFE SEEMED TO STRETCH BEFORE HER AGAIN AS ALONG BRIGHT VISTA.MEANWHILE POOR HILDA GREW DAILY MORE DREAMY AND UNPRACTICAL MORENEGLECTFUL OF HOME DUTIES MORE OBLIVIOUS OF ALL THAT LAY OUTSIDE THEROSY CURTAINS WHICH SCREENED HER OWN INNER WORLD OF SELFCONSCIOUSEMOTION. EVEN ALDYTH FELT IMPELLED TO TAKE HER TO TASK SOMETIMES.YOU ARE GETTING LAZY HILDA SHE EXCLAIMED ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS ATMRS. BLANDS AND HEARD HILDA REFUSE TO CARRY A SOUP TICKET TO A POORWOMAN WHOM MRS. BLAND WAS DESIROUS OF HELPING.KITTY WHO WAS PRESENT HAD AT ONCE VOLUNTEERED TO DO THE ERRAND ANDWAS NOW BUTTONING HER BOOTS BY THE FIRE.OH IT IS REALLY TOO COLD TO GO OUT THIS MORNING SAID HILDALOUNGING IN HER EASYCHAIR BY THE FIRE WITH HER PRETTY LITTLE FEET ONTHE FENDER. KITTY DOES NOT MIND THE COLD BUT I HATE TO GO OUT BEFOREI HAVE HAD TIME TO GET THOROUGHLY WARM.THERE IS ONE KIND OF POETRY HILDA DOES NOT APPRECIATE REMARKEDKITTYTHE POETRY OF MOTION.AND SHE HAS YET TO LEARN THAT ONE SHOULD OCCASIONALLY SACRIFICE ONESOWN INCLINATIONS FOR THE SAKE OF HELPING OTHERS SAID HER MOTHER INRATHER A SEVERE TONE AS SHE QUITTED THE ROOM.AS SOON AS SHE WAS ALONE WITH HER FRIEND HILDA BURST INTO TEARS.THAT IS ALWAYS THE WAY NOW SHE SAID. MOTHER IS FOR EVER FINDINGFAULT WITH ME. KITTY IS HER FAVOURITE DAUGHTER AND NOTHING THAT I DOIS RIGHT.NONSENSE HILDA SAID ALDYTH YOU FANCY SUCH THINGS. I DO NOTBELIEVE MRS. BLAND HAS A FAVOURITE BUT KITTY IS OF COURSE A GREAT HELPTO HER.YES BUT THEN KITTY LIKES DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS SAID HILDAVAGUELY. SHE IS SO DIFFERENT FROM ME. I DO NOT GET ANY SYMPATHY FROMHER. SHE LAUGHS AT MY LOVE OF POETRY AND AS FOR MOTHER I AM SURE SHEGRUDGES ME THE TIME I GIVE TO SELFIMPROVEMENT. I SUPPOSE SHE WISHES IWERE LIKE KITTY WHO SCARCELY EVER READS ANYTHING EXCEPT A NOVEL.NOW YOU ARE WRONGING YOUR MOTHER SAID ALDYTH QUICKLY. I AM SURESHE WAS VERY PLEASED THAT YOU AND I SHOULD STUDY TOGETHER FOR THELECTURES. BUT TALKING OF NOVELS WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN I CAME IN ISNOT THAT A NOVEL I SEE IN YOUR LAPCERTAINLY IT IS SAID HILDA BUT SUCH A NOVEL AND SHE HELD UPROMOLA TO VIEW.AH THAT IS A GRAND BOOK SAID ALDYTH TERRIBLY SAD YET AS TRUE ASIT IS SAD. I CAN NEVER LOSE THE IMPRESSION MADE ON ME BY ITS REVELATIONOF THE SLOW BUT SURE DECLINE INTO EVIL OF TITOSO BRIGHT AND LOVABLEAND UNSULLIED AS WE SEE HIM AT FIRST THAT WE LOVE HIM ALMOST AS ROMOLADOES AND SHARE THE BITTERNESS OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT.YES IT IS VERY SAD SAID HILDA BUT WHAT A SPLENDID WOMAN ROMOLAIS. I HAVE JUST BEEN READING HOW SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TO THOSE POORPEOPLE DYING OF THE PESTILENCE. THEY MIGHT WELL TAKE HER FOR THEMADONNA. OH TO GO AMONGST THE POOR AND SUFFERING LIKE THAT WOULD BE ALIFE WORTH LIVING I OFTEN WISH THAT I COULD BE TRAINED AS A NURSE BUTMOTHER WOULD NEVER HEAR OF MY LEAVING HOME. IT IS HORRID TO LIVE IN APLACE LIKE WOODHAM WHERE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE.ONLY SOME POOR PEOPLE TO BE VISITED AND SUPPLIED WITH SOUP TICKETSSAID ALDYTH MISCHIEVOUSLY.HILDA COLOURED. OH THAT IS NOTHING SHE SAID.IT IS ONLY A SMALL THING CERTAINLY SAID ALDYTH. BUT I THINK THESMALL DUTIES MAY PREPARE US FOR GREAT ONES IF WE SHOULD EVER BE CALLEDTO UNDERTAKE THEM. HE THAT IS FAITHFUL IN THAT WHICH IS LEAST ISFAITHFUL ALSO IN MUCH. BUT HILDA I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU HAD ANYLEANING TOWARDS A NURSES VOCATION. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT KIND OFWORK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT ALL TO YOUR TASTE.PERHAPS NOT SAID HILDA LOOKING PIQUED BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL THETHOUGHTS THAT I HAVE.AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT ALDYTH UNDERSTOOD HER NO BETTER THAN DIDHER MOTHER AND SISTER.THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN HILDA ASKED ARE YOU GOING TO RIDE TODAYNO SAID ALDYTH. GUY HAS GONE TO COLCHESTER BUT HE PROPOSES THAT WESHOULD ALL HAVE A RIDE ON SATURDAYYOU ON BROWN BESS. YOU FEEL QUITECOMFORTABLE ON HER NOW DO YOU NOTYES INDEED I AM NOT A BIT AFRAID OF HER NOW SAID HILDA HER FACELIGHTING UP WITH PLEASURE. I SHALL ENJOY ANOTHER RIDE. AND OH ALDYTHWHAT DO YOU THINK MOTHER SAYS WE MAY HAVE A PARTY ON MY TWENTYFIRSTBIRTHDAY. WONT THAT BE LOVELY MIND YOU KEEP YOURSELF DISENGAGED FORTHE TWENTYTHIRD.NO DOUBT OF THAT SAID ALDYTH. PARTIES ARE NOT SO NUMEROUS ATWOODHAM THAT I AM LIKELY TO HAVE ANOTHER INVITATION FOR THAT DATE. IWILL TELL GUY TO KEEP HIMSELF FREE FOR I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN TO INVITEHIMI DARE SAY MOTHER WILL SEND HIM AN INVITATION SAID HILDA DEMURELY.THEN SHE LAUGHED. PERHAPS HE WILL NOT CARE TO COME BUT I DO HOPE ITWILL BE A NICE PARTY. MOTHER TALKS OF SENDING OUT FIFTY INVITATIONS.YOUR PARTIES ALWAYS ARE NICE SAID ALDYTH. AND THIS IS THE MOTHERWITH WHOM YOU ARE NOT A FAVOURITE OH HILDA HILDA YOU DO NOT DESERVETO HAVE SUCH A MOTHER.AS THE DAYS PASSED BY AND CHRISTMAS DREW NEAR THE PROPOSED PARTY INHONOUR OF HILDAS ATTAINING HER MAJORITY BECAME A MATTER OF ABSORBINGINTEREST TO THE THREE GIRLSAN INTEREST WHICH WHEN THE INVITATIONS HADBEEN ISSUED WAS SHARED BY MANY OTHERS AT WOODHAM.WOULD MR. GLYNNE ACCEPT OR DECLINE WAS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF HISREMAINING AT WOODHAM FOR CHRISTMAS ALDYTH COULD NOT ANSWER THESEQUESTIONS. SHE KNEW THAT MR. GLYNNES SISTER WAS RECOVERING FROM HERFEVER BUT WHETHER HER CONVALESCENCE HAD ADVANCED TO SUCH A STAGE AS TORENDER IT SAFE FOR HIM TO RETURN HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS SHE COULD NOTSAY. SOMEHOW DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS JOHN GLYNNE HAD FALLEN OUT OFTHE HABIT OF PAYING FREQUENT VISITS TO MISS LORRAINES COTTAGE NOR HADTHE BLANDS SEEN MUCH OF HIM OF LATE. BUT THE EXAMINATIONS WERE TAKINGPLACE AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL. IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR THE MASTERS THEREWAS NO DIFFICULTY IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT MR. GLYNNE HAD LITTLELEISURE TO BESTOW UPON HIS FRIENDS.CHAPTER X.HILDA BLANDS PARTY.THE PARTY GIVEN IN HONOUR OF HILDAS COMING OF AGE WAS AN EVENING PARTYOF THE GOOD OLDFASHIONED SORT. MRS. BLANDS GUESTS BEGAN TO ARRIVEABOUT SEVEN AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE EXPECTED TO RETIRE SHORTLYAFTER MIDNIGHT. THE DINING ROOM WAS GIVEN OVER TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHOHAD PLANNED SOME TABLEAUX VIVANTS FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE COMPANY.THE OLDER AND GRAVER GUESTS GATHERED IN THE DRAWING ROOM. SUPPER WAS TOBE SERVED IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM PART OF THE HALL BEING CURTAINED OFFCLEVERLY AS AN ADDITION TO ITS LIMITED SPACE.THE EVENING PASSED BRIGHTLY AWAY. THE TABLEAUX PROVED A GRAND SUCCESS.KITTY PERSUADED JOHN GLYNNE WHO WAS PRESENT TO TAKE PART IN THEM ANDHIS PERFECT SELFCONTROL AND REMARKABLE IMMOBILITY OF FEATURE MADE HIMA VALUABLE ADDITION TO THE ACTORS. THE TABLEAUX IN WHICH HE APPEAREDAS CHARLES VII. WHILST KITTY MADE A SPIRITEDLOOKING JOAN OF ARC WASTHE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE SERIES. SUNDRY AMUSEMENTS SUCCEEDED TO THETABLEAUX AND NO ONE LOOKING ON THE GAY ANIMATED SCENE COULD HAVEIMAGINED THAT CARE LURKED IN A SINGLE BOSOM THERE.HILDA THE HEROINE OF THE OCCASION LOOKED CHARMING ATTIRED IN WHITEWITH A NECKLACE OF PEARLS HER MOTHERS GIFT ADORNING A THROATSCARCELY LESS MILKY IN HUE. HER SLIGHT FORM IN ITS SNOWY DRAPERY HADA FAIRYLIKE PRETTINESS AND HER MOTHER MIGHT BE PARDONED IF HER EYESSOMETIMES RESTED UPON THIS FAIR DAUGHTER WITH LOOKS OF PRIDE.HILDA WORE PINNED TO HER GOWN A BUNCH OF CHRISTMAS ROSES AND AZALEASAND HER DELIGHT IN THESE FLOWERS WHICH GUY HAD SENT HER WITH HISCONGRATULATIONS WAS UNBOUNDED TILL SHE SAW THAT A LOVELY CLUSTER OFMARCHAL NIEL ROSES ADORNED ALDYTHS BLACK LACE BODICE AND KNEW THATTHEY ALSO WERE A GIFT FROM GUY. THE SIGHT OF THEM CAUSED HER A THROBOF PAIN AND WITH IT CAME A DREADFUL PRESENTIMENT THAT THE EVENING TOWHICH SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD WITH SUCH EAGER ANTICIPATION WAS TO YIELDHER ONLY PAIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT.AS THE EVENING PASSED ON ALDYTH BECAME AWARE THAT GUY WAS PAYINGBUT SLIGHT ATTENTION TO HILDA WHILST RATHER TO HER ANNOYANCESHE FOUND HIM CONSTANTLY BESIDE HERSELF. WHAT DID IT MEAN HAD ANYMISUNDERSTANDING ARISEN BETWEEN HIM AND HILDA IF SO IT WAS A PITYFOR ALDYTH WHO HAD THE SYMPATHETIC INSIGHT OF A LOVING SOUL COULDSEE THAT HILDA THOUGH SHE DID HER BEST TO MAINTAIN A GAY DEMEANOURWAS NOT REALLY ENJOYING HERSELF. SHE FELT CERTAIN THAT SHE SHOULD HEARTHE TRUTH SOONER OR LATER FROM GUY WHO WAS TO STAY THE NIGHT ATMISS LORRAINES. MEANWHILE SHE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RID HERSELF OF HISUNWELCOME ATTENTIONS.NONSENSE GUY SHE SAID WHEN HE CAME TO ASK HER HAND FOR A DANCE.I AM SURE YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE HILDA FOR YOUR PARTNER. WHY DO YOUKEEP ALOOF FROM HER TONIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS SURELY YOU TWO HAVE NOTQUARRELLEDGUY COLOURED AND LOOKED CONFUSED.I HAVE DANCED ONCE WITH HILDA HE SAID. POLITENESS DOES NOT REQUIREMORE.ALDYTH WAS AMAZED. THEN THEY MUST HAVE HAD A QUARREL. BUT SHE SAID NOMORE KNOWING THAT WORDS ARE WORSE THAN USELESS IN SUCH CASES.THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT KITTY WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME AND MISSLORRAINE WHOSE CAPACITY FOR ENJOYING SUCH GATHERINGS DID NOT WANE WITHADVANCING YEARS ENTERED INTO THE FUN WITH SCARCELY LESS ZEST. SHE WASAN EXCELLENT PERFORMER OF CHEERFUL MUSIC AND SHE SAT AT THE PIANOPLAYING ONE LIVELY AIR AFTER ANOTHER PAUSING ONLY TO INSTRUCT THEYOUNG FOLK AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE OLD COUNTRY DANCES SHOULD BEEXECUTED.ALDYTH WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME WONDER THAT SHE HERSELF DID NOT FIND THEEVENING MORE ENJOYABLE. SHE WAS NOT OVER FOND OF DANCING AND SHE SOONWEARIED OF THE HEAT AND BUSTLE. ALDYTH HAD RATHER A POOR OPINION OFTHE YOUNG MEN OF WOODBURN AND THIS EVENINGS EXPERIENCE DID NOT RAISEIT. SHE FELT IMPATIENT OF THE VAPID TALK OF SOME WHO ENGAGED HER INCONVERSATION WHILST JOHN GLYNNE REMAINED AT A DISTANCE. SHE WOULD HAVELIKED TO TALK WITH HIM BUT HE APPARENTLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER.LATER IN THE EVENING ALDYTH THOROUGHLY WEARIED SLIPPED INTO THEDRAWING ROOM. MRS. BLAND WELCOMED HER WITH A SMILE. OLD CAPTAIN CLEARA RETIRED NAVAL OFFICER AND ONE OF THE OLDEST INHABITANTS OF WOODHAMCAME ACROSS THE ROOM TO ASK HER IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT SHE WASALREADY WEARY.SHE SAW JOHN GLYNNE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM PLAYING ATCHESS WITH MR. GREENWOOD. AS SHE WATCHED THEM HE MADE A MOVE WHICHCHECKMATED HIS ADVERSARY. THEN HE ROSE TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER PLAYER.HIS EYES FELL ON ALDYTH AND HE CAME DOWN THE ROOM AS IT SEEMED TOHER WITH THE INTENTION OF ADDRESSING HER. BUT ERE HE REACHED HERSIDE HE SUDDENLY HALTED AND BEGAN TO STUDY A SWISS VIEW HANGINGON THE WALL AND AT THE SAME MOMENT ALDYTH NOT WITHOUT SOME SECRETIRRITATION HEARD GUYS VOICE BESIDE HER.SO HERE YOU ARE AT LAST ALDYTH. I HAVE BEEN HUNTING FOR YOUEVERYWHERE. WHAT MADE YOU COME IN HEREI WAS TIRED GUY. I DO NOT WISH TO BE THERE ANY LONGER ALL RIGHTTHEN WELL STAY HERE HE SAID AND SEATED HIMSELF BY HER SIDE WITH ANAIR OF PROPRIETORSHIP WHICH WAS NOT LOST UPON ONE PERSON PRESENT.GUY THOUGHT HE WAS ACTING HIS PART WELL THAT EVENING. IT COST HIMSOMETHING TO KEEP AWAY FROM HILDA AND HE TOOK CREDIT TO HIMSELF FORTHUS SACRIFICING HIS INCLINATIONS. HE HAD RECEIVED SOME POWERFUL HINTSFROM HIS UNCLE WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTY.OLD STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS GUYS DUTY TO PROVIDESOME CHOICE FLOWERS FOR ALDYTH TO WEAR. HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEFACT THAT HIS SUGGESTION HAD ALSO CONVEYED TO GUYS MIND THE IDEA OF ABIRTHDAY BOUQUET FOR HILDA FOR OF THAT HE KNEW NOTHING.GUY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS COURTSHIP WAS PROCEEDING TOOSLOWLY AND THAT HIS UNCLE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR SOMETHING DECISIVEBY THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR. SO HE WAS TRYING TO BRING HIMSELFTO MAKE THE NECESSARY SACRIFICE OF HIS HAPPINESS AND STRANGE TOSAY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ALSOTHE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER AND THAT THE ACTION HE CONTEMPLATED MIGHTPOSSIBLY HAVE THAT RESULT.AT MIDNIGHT THE GUESTS BEGAN TO DEPART. MR. GLYNNE AND THE GREENWOODSWERE AMONGST THE FIRST TO GO MISS LORRAINE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALDYTHSTAYED TO THE VERY END. THE ELDER LADY WAS FRESH AS A FLOWER AND FULLOF TALK TO THE LAST. SHE STOOD ON THE DOORSTEP SAYING GOODNIGHT TOFRIENDS AND ALDYTH JUST WITHIN THE HALL WAS HASTILY FASTENING HERFURLINED CLOAK WHEN GUY DETAINED HER.HE HAD CAUGHT A ROSEBUD FALLING FROM HER GOWN.SEE ALDYTH I SHALL KEEP THIS HE SAID IT IS PRECIOUS TO ME SINCEYOU HAVE WORN IT.OH PLEASE DONT BE RIDICULOUS SAID ALDYTH CONSCIOUS AS HE WASNOT THAT HILDA STOOD WITHIN HEARING HALFSCREENED BY THE HEAVYCURTAIN THAT HAD BEEN DRAWN ACROSS THE HALL.BUT GUY HAD HIS BACK TOWARDS THE CURTAIN. HAVING SECURED THE FLOWER HELAID HIS HAND ON ALDYTHS CLOAK SAYING WITH AN AIR OF SOLICITUDE ASHE DREW IT MORE CLOSELY ABOUT HER ARE YOU SURE THIS IS ENOUGH IT ISA VERY COLD NIGHT.OH REALLY GUY CRIED ALDYTH MAKING A DASH AT THE DOOR AND THENTURNING TO UTTER A GENERAL GOODNIGHT TO THOSE WHO YET LINGERED INTHE HALL. AS SHE DID SO SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HILDA PEEPING ROUND THECURTAIN HER FACE WHITE AS HER GOWN HER EYES FULL OF TROUBLE.EVIDENTLY THEY HAVE FALLEN OUT SHE THOUGHT AND GUY SILLY FELLOWIS TRYING TO MAKE HER JEALOUS BY DEVOTING HIMSELF TO ME. BUT HOW ABSURDOF HILDA TO LET IT TROUBLE HER FOR A MOMENTAND ALDYTH WALKED ON QUICKLY FEELING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH GUY.DONT BE IN SUCH A HURRY ALDYTH HE SAID AND MADE AN ATTEMPT TODRAW HER HAND WITHIN HIS ARM BUT ALDYTH FOUND THAT SHE REQUIRED BOTHHANDS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HER GOWN. I SCARCELY EVER GET YOU TOMYSELF NOW.ALDYTH LAUGHED IN A WAY MOST SUITORS WOULD HAVE FOUND DISCOURAGING.WE SEE AS MUCH OF EACH OTHER AS MOST COUSINS DO SHE SAID THE NEXTMINUTE IN THE MOST MATTEROFFACT TONE.DO YOU NEVER THINK OF ME EXCEPT AS A COUSIN HE ASKED.WHY NO SAID ALDYTH IN AS COLD A TONE AS BEFORE. I CANNOT SAY THATI DO. WHY SHOULD IALDYTH HE SAID QUICKLY IT IS UNKIND TO ANSWER ME SO. YOU MUSTKNOW THAT I CARE VERY MUCH HOW YOU THINK OF ME.SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT BUT THE LIGHT OF THE CLEAR FROSTY NIGHTDID NOT ENABLE HER TO READ HIS FACE.REALLY GUY SHE SAID DONT YOU THINK YOU HAVE CARRIED THISNONSENSE FAR ENOUGH HILDA IS NOT HERE TO BE PIQUED BY YOUR PRETENDEDDEVOTION TO ME.PRETENDED DEVOTION WHAT CAN MAKE YOU SAY THAT SAID GUY. I DONOT KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD BRING IN HILDAS NAME IT IS YOU I DESIRE TOPLEASE. MY HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON MY WINNING YOUR LOVE.GUYWHY SHOULD YOU BE SO SURPRISED ALDYTH YOU MUST KNOW THAT I LOVE YOUAND THAT UNCLE AND EVERY ONE BELIEVES THAT WE SHALL BE MARRIED.INDEED SAID ALDYTH IN A STRANGE HARD TONE. HOW LONG HAS IT BEENSO I WONDER WAS IT UNCLE SUGGESTED THE IDEA TO YOU GUYWHAT DO YOU MEAN ALDYTH OF COURSE IT IS MY OWN WISH.OH IT IS SATISFACTORY TO KNOW THAT REPLIED ALDYTH IN A COLD TONENOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF SARCASM. BUT UNCLE HAS SPOKEN TO YOU ON THESUBJECTWHY YES HE HAS ANSWERED GUY AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY. HE TOLD MEHOW MUCH HE WISHED IT.AND IT IS AT HIS DICTATION THAT YOU HONOUR ME WITH THIS EXPRESSION OFHIS AND YOUR WISH PERSISTED ALDYTH.WELL YESNOI SHOULD NOT PUT IT IN THAT WAY FALTERED GUY I WISHIT VERY MUCH INDEED ALDYTH.I DARE SAY REPLIED HIS COUSIN COLDLY. UNCLE HAS A WAY OF MAKINGOTHER PEOPLES WISHES CONCUR WITH HIS OWN. BUT GUY I SHOULD HAVETHOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO MANLY TO YIELD TO HIM IN SUCH A MATTERAS THIS. PERHAPS YOU THINK THERE IS NO HARM IN ASKING A WOMAN TO MARRYYOU WHOM YOU DO NOT LOVE BUT I CAN TELL YOU I LOOK ON THE WORDS YOUHAVE SPOKEN TO ME TONIGHT AS LITTLE LESS THAN AN INSULT.AN INSULT ALDYTH WHAT A WORD TO USE AND I DO LOVE YOU YOU KNOW IDO.AS A COUSIN PERHAPS BUT NOT AS A HUSBAND SHOULD LOVE HIS WIFE. GUYDO YOU THINK I HAVE BEEN BLIND TO ALL THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON BETWEENYOU AND HILDA BLAND DO YOU SUPPOSE I CANNOT SEE THAT HER SOCIETY HASMORE ATTRACTION FOR YOU THAN MINEFOR A MOMENT GUY WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY. HE WAS CONFUSED ANDIRRITATED UNDER THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALDYTH UNDERSTOOD HIM TOO WELL.HE HAD HOPED THAT SHE WOULD REJECT HIM YET NOW THAT SHE DID SO HE WASVIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE ANNOYING CONSEQUENCES THAT MUST ENSUE FOR HIMAND FELT AN OBSTINATE DESIRE TO CHANGE HER MIND.YOU NEED NOT BE JEALOUS OF HILDA HE BEGAN BUT ALDYTH CHECKED HIMINDIGNANTLY.HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING I JEALOUS OF HILDA INDEED YOUMISTAKE ME UTTERLY IF YOU THINK I COULD ENTERTAIN SUCH A FEELING FOR AMOMENT.THEN I HOPE YOU WILL BELIEVE HOW MUCH I CARE FOR YOU AND SAY THAT YOUWILL BE MY WIFE.

I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PLEASE UNCLE IN ALL THAT IS RIGHT BUT IWILL NOT DO WRONG FOR THE SAKE OF HIM OR ANY ONE AND I SHOULD BE DOINGA GREAT WRONG IF I CONSENTED TO MARRY YOU FEELING TOWARDS YOU AS I DO.YOU CANNOT LOVE MENOT IN THAT WAY CERTAINLY REPLIED ALDYTH. PLEASE SAY NO MORE ABOUTIT GUY. IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION.UNCLE WILL BE VERY ANGRY SAID GUY.LET HIM BE ANGRY SAID ALDYTH WARMLY. AND GUY WHATEVER YOU DONEVER TRY TO MAKE LOVE TO ME AGAIN.THEY WERE AT THE GATE. MISS LORRAINE STOOD AT THE OPEN DOOR LOOKING FORTHEM. THEY HURRIED UP THE PATH AND WENT INSIDE. GUY LINGERED IN THEHALL DIVESTING HIMSELF OF HIS OVERCOAT. ALDYTH LIGHTED HER BEDROOMCANDLE AT ONCE.YOU MUST BE TIRED AUNTIE SHE SAID WE WILL TALK IT OVERTOMORROWGOODNIGHT GUY.AND SHE WENT UP STAIRS WITHOUT SAYING SNORE.A BRIGHT LITTLE FIRE HAD BEEN KINDLED IN HER ROOM. ALDYTH THREW OFFHER CLOAK AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE. HER MIND WAS IN A CONFUSIONOF SHAME AND INDIGNATION AND A PAIN SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. IT WASHORRID OF GUY TO SAY WHAT HE HAD. HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN BETTER. HER FACEBURNED AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE INDIGNITY SHE HAD RECEIVED. SHE FELTKEENLY ANNOYED BOTH WITH GUY AND WITH HER GREATUNCLE.BUT IT CAN NEVER BE SHE SAID TO HERSELF. UNCLE CANNOT SETTLE THATFOR ME. THANK GOD NO ONE CAN FORCE ME INTO A MARRIAGE. MARRY GUYNEVER I WOULD RATHER DIE NOTHING SHALL MAKE ME MARRY A MAN I CANNOTLOVE AND REVERENCE. I WILL CONTENT MYSELF WITH NO UNION THAT FALLSSHORT OF MY IDEAL OF WHAT MARRIAGE SHOULD BE. RATHER THAN THAT I WILLREMAIN SINGLE ALL MY LIFE. I AM NOT AFRAID OF BEING AN OLD MAID LIKEAUNTIE. HERS IS BY NO MEANS AN UNHAPPY LIFE.HERE ALDYTHS EYES LOOKING UPWARDS MET THE GLANCE OF HER MOTHERLOOKING DOWN ON HER FROM THE PORTRAIT ON THE MANTELSHELF. THE NEXTMINUTE A MIST OF TEARS DIMMED ALDYTHS VISION.IF ONLY SHE WERE HERE I COULD TELL HER SHE MURMURED. I SHRINK FROMSPEAKING OF IT TO AUNTIE BUT TO MOTHER IT WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT. IKNOW SHE WOULD FEEL AS I DO ABOUT IT. ONE CAN ALWAYS BE SURE OF ONESMOTHER.CHAPTER XI.CHRISTMAS AT WYNDHAM.ONE OF ALDYTHS CHIEF THOUGHTS WHEN SHE WOKE IN THE MORNING WAS THATTHE MORROW WOULD BE CHRISTMAS DAY AND THAT SHE AND HER AUNT WERE TODINE AS USUAL AT WYNDHAM HALL. THE PROSPECT WAS FAR FROM AGREEABLETO HER. SHE WAS TOO ANNOYED WITH GUY TO WISH TO SEE HIM AGAIN SO SOONAND SHE DREADED THAT HER UNCLE MIGHT MAKE SOME ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE HERTO DO AS HE WISHED. SHE KNEW TOO WELL THE IRON STRENGTH OF HIS WILL TOSUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EASILY RESIGN HIMSELF TO THE FRUSTRATION OF HISHOPES.BUT THOUGH ALDYTH FELT THAT IT WOULD BE INTENSELY UNPLEASANT TO HAVEANY WORDS WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT SHE HAD NO FEAR THAT ANYTHING HERUNCLE MIGHT SAY COULD MOVE HER. SHE TOO WAS A LORRAINE AND WAS NOTTO BE LIGHTLY COERCED. SHE WAS CERTAIN THAT HER FEELINGS TOWARDS GUYCOULD NEVER CHANGE. NOTHING COULD MAKE IT RIGHT FOR HER TO MARRY HIMNO ARGUMENT COULD CONVINCE HER OF THE CONTRARY.I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PLEASE UNCLE SHE SAID TO HERSELF BUTTHIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. MOTHER COULD NEVER WISH THIS.CHRISTMAS DAY AFTER ALL PASSED MORE PLEASANTLY THAN ALDYTH EXPECTED.SHE WENT TO CHURCH WITH HER AUNT IN THE MORNING AND ON COMING OUT OFCHURCH THEY WALKED A FEW STEPS WITH THE BLANDS AND MR. GLYNNE WHOMMRS. BLAND HAD INVITED TO DINE WITH HER FAMILY. HILDA SEEMED OUT OFSPIRITS AND ALDYTH FANCIED THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN HER FRIENDSMANNER TOWARDS HER. THE THOUGHT MADE HER UNCOMFORTABLE. SHE HOPED HILDAWOULD NEVER KNOW OF GUYS FOOLISH CONDUCT WITH REGARD TO HERSELF.SHE WOULD BE SO HURT THOUGHT ALDYTH AND AFTER ALL HE CARES FARMORE FOR HER THAN FOR ME. BUT I WISH SHE DID NOT THINK SO MUCH OF HIMFOR I DOUBT IF HE REALLY DESERVES HER LOVE.SOON AFTER ALDYTH AND HER AUNT RETURNED FROM CHURCH THE CARRIAGEARRIVED TO TAKE THEM TO WYNDHAM. MISS LORRAINE THOUGHT IT STRANGE THATGUY HAD NOT COME UP TO WOODHAM TO FETCH THEM. BUT GUY WAS OTHERWISEENGAGED. HE HAD HAD THE FORETHOUGHT TO INVITE HIS FRIEND CAPTAIN WALKERTO COME FROM COLCHESTER TO SPEND CHRISTMAS DAY AT WYNDHAM. HE HADGIVEN THE INVITATION WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS UNCLE AND MR. LORRAINEWAS SECRETLY ANNOYED AT THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS GUEST INTO THE FAMILYPARTY THOUGH HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO WITHHOLD FROM THECAPTAIN A HOSPITABLE WELCOME.TO ALDYTH THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN WALKER WAS A RELIEF. IT MADE IT EASYFOR HER TO MEET GUY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. THE LONG EVENING PASSEDNOT UNPLEASANTLY FOR HER. THE CAPTAIN WAS MUSICAL HE HAD BROUGHT HISVIOLIN AND HE WAS THOROUGHLY HAPPY AS HE ACCOMPANIED ALDYTHS PLAYINGON THE PIANO. THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID OF THE OTHERS WHO WERE PRESENT.STEPHEN LORRAINE WAS INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING MUSIC AND HE DID NOTLIKE THE WAY IN WHICH CAPTAIN WALKER MONOPOLIZED HIS YOUNG NIECE. GUYHAD REFRAINED FROM TELLING HIS UNCLE THAT ALDYTH HAD REJECTED HIM BUTOLD STEPHENS KEEN EYES SAW ENOUGH THAT EVENING TO CONVINCE HIM THATTHE MATTER WAS NOT PROGRESSING AS HE WISHED. HE COULD HARDLY CONTROLHIS IMPATIENCE AND MISS LORRAINE GREW UNEASY AS SHE OBSERVED THE DARKILLHUMOUR THAT WAS SETTLING ON HIS COUNTENANCE AND THE IRRITABLETONES IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED GUY.THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS NOT SLOW TO PERCEIVE THAT A STORM WAS BREWINGBUT HE HOPED TO AVOID HAVING ANY WORDS WITH HIS UNCLE THAT NIGHT.ALDYTH AND HER AUNT WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT AT WYNDHAM. WHEN THEY HADRETIRED GUY AND HIS FRIEND BADE MR. LORRAINE GOODNIGHT AND WENTOFF TO THE FORMERS DEN FOR A SMOKE.GUY CONGRATULATED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD MANAGED WELL BUT THERE HAD BEENA PECULIAR GRIMNESS IN HIS UNCLES TONE AS HE BADE HIM GOODNIGHTWHICH AUGURED ILL FOR THE TIME WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TO COME TO ANUNDERSTANDING. GUY THOUGHT HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DEFERRING THAT EVIL HOURAT LEAST TILL THE MORROW BUT WHEN ABOUT MIDNIGHT HAVING CONDUCTEDHIS FRIEND TO HIS ROOM HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO HIS OWN AT THE EXTREME ENDOF THE CORRIDOR HE PERCEIVED A STREAM OF LIGHT RADIATING THE DARKNESSFROM HIS UNCLES DOOR WHICH STOOD AJAR AND AS HE APPROACHED ITHEARD HIS NAME CALLED IN SHARP TONESGUY GUYYES SIR SAID GUY PUSHING BACK THE DOOR.IT IS NOT SO LATE BUT THAT YOU CAN SPARE ME A FEW MINUTES. COME IN IFYOU PLEASE AND SHUT THE DOOR. I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU.GUY WITH A DISAGREEABLE PREVISION OF WHAT WAS COMING DID AS HE WASTOLD.HIS UNCLE WRAPPED IN AN OLD RED DRESSINGGOWN HIS VELVET CAP STILL ONHIS HEAD SAT IN A HIGHBACKED CHAIR BY THE FIRE. THE CANDLES BURNINGON THE MANTELSHELF THREW THEIR LIGHT ON HIS FACE AND SHOWED IT MOREYELLOW SUNKEN AND FURROWED THAN IT APPEARED BY DAYLIGHT.GUY STOOD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE TALL AND ERECT LOOKINGDOWN ON HIM.TAKE A CHAIR CANT YOU SAID THE OLD MAN IRRITABLY.GUY DREW UP A CHAIR.I WANT TO KNOW SAID HIS UNCLE GOING AT ONCE TO THE POINT WHETHERANYTHING IS YET SETTLED BETWEEN YOU AND ALDYTHYES SIR SAID GUY IT IS SO FAR SETTLED THAT ALDYTH HAS DECLINED TOBE MY WIFE.YOU HAVE ASKED HER AND SHE HAS REFUSED YOUIN THE MOST DECIDED MANNER. IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION SHE SAYS.OLD STEPHENS BROW DARKENED.BAH YOU HAVE DONE YOUR WOOING BADLY HE SAID. YOU MUST NOT TAKEANY NOTICE OF THAT. THE NEXT TIME YOU ASK HER SHE WILL RESPONDDIFFERENTLY.I CANNOT ASK HER AGAIN SAID GUY.CANNOT YOU MUST I TELL YOU.EXCUSE ME SIR SAID GUY. SHE HAS TOLD ME THE THING IS IMPOSSIBLESHE HAS EVEN SAID THAT SHE REGARDS MY PROPOSAL AS AN INSULT. AFTER THATI CANNOT REPEAT IT.AH YOU HAVE LET HER SEE THAT YOU ARE A HALFHEARTED SUITOR SAID THEOLD MAN SHREWDLY. THAT WILL NEVER DO. YOU MUST MANAGE BETTER NEXTTIME.THERE CAN BE NO NEXT TIME SAID GUY HIS TEMPER AND COURAGE RISINGTOGETHER. TO PLEASE YOU I HAVE ASKED MY COUSIN TO MARRY ME BUT SINCESHE REFUSES I NOW CLAIM A RIGHT TO CHOOSE A WIFE FOR MYSELF.AND WHOM WOULD YOU CHOOSE PRAY ASKED HIS UNCLE REGARDING HIM WITHA NARROW PENETRATING GLANCE. COME TELL ME FOR I CAN SEE YOU HAVESOME ONE IN YOUR MIND.GUY HESITATED BUT HAVING DARED SO MUCH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHTAS WELL DARE ALL. PERHAPS IF HE SHOWED SOME SPIRIT AND MADE IT CLEARTHAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO DO AS HE LIKED HIS UNCLE WOULD YIELD TO THEINEVITABLE.YOU ARE RIGHT SIR HE SAID. SINCE ALDYTH HAS REFUSED ME I WILL OWNTHAT HILDA BLAND IS THE GIRL I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE MY WIFE.HILDA BLAND THAT WHITEFACED GIRL HARDLY BIGGER THAN A FULLSIZEDDOLL WHAT FOLLY EXCLAIMED STEPHEN LORRAINE HIS INDIGNATION BLAZINGFORTH AT THIS CONFIRMATION OF HIS SUSPICION. LET ME HEAR NO MOREOF THIS GUY. HILDA BLAND IS NOT ONE WHOM I COULD THINK OF AS THEMISTRESS OF WYNDHAM.GUYS FACE GREW HOT. HE NATURALLY RESENTED HIS UNCLES REMARKS. ANANGRY REPLY RUSHED TO HIS LIPS BUT THE MENTION OF WYNDHAM CHECKED IT.HERE WAS A THOUGHT THAT BID HIM PAUSE.IF YOU KNEW HILDA BETTER UNCLE YOU WOULD APPRECIATE HER MOREHIGHLY HE SAID FORCING HIMSELF TO SPEAK CALMLY. IT IS HARD THATYOU WILL NOT THINK OF MY HAPPINESS.I DO THINK OF YOUR HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF ALDYTHS ALSO SAID HISUNCLE SIGNIFICANTLY. YOU CAN OF COURSE MAKE HILDA YOUR WIFE IF YOUCHOOSE BUT SHE WILL NOT BE THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM.GUY HAD RISEN AND STOOD LOOKING BLANKLY AT HIS UNCLE.YES SAID THE OLD MAN I MEAN IT. THERE IS NO NEED TO SAY MORE. YOUUNDERSTAND ME NOW. GOODNIGHT.GOODNIGHT SAID GUY MECHANICALLY AS HE TURNED AWAY HAVINGRECEIVED A POOR PREPARATION FOR A NIGHTS REST. HE FELT THAT HE WASBEING VERY HARDLY TREATED. IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM THAT ONE EFFECTOF HIS UNCLES OPPOSITION WAS TO INTENSIFY HIS DESIRE TO WED HILDA.ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PRESENT EMBARRASSMENT WAS THAT HE WASBEGINNING TO FEEL TOWARDS ALDYTH SOMETHING LIKE DISLIKE IN PLACE OF HISOLD COUSINLY AFFECTION FOR HER.THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WORDS SHE HAD UTTERED AND THE SCORN SHE HADBEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL WHEN HE MADE HIS PROPOSAL RANKLED IN HIS MINDAND HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT NOTHING SHOULD EVER INDUCE HIM TO APPROACH THESUBJECT WITH HER AGAIN. AND NOW HIS UNCLES WORDS RESPECTING WYNDHAMHAD SUGGESTED A JEALOUS DREAD OF THE OLD MANS AFFECTION FOR ALDYTH.DID THEY NOT MEAN THAT IN THE EVENT OF HIS MARRYING HILDA ALDYTH WOULDBE MADE HEIRESS OF WYNDHAM WAS EVER THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE MOREBLOCKED AND BARRED GUY DID NOT DOUBT THAT HIS WAS A CASE TO WHICH THEFAMILIAR QUOTATION MIGHT BE APTLY APPLIED.STEPHEN LORRAINE WAS CONTENT TO VISIT HIS CHAGRIN SOLELY UPON GUY. HISMANNER TOWARDS ALDYTH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN KINDER THAN IT WAS ON THEFOLLOWING DAY. HE WAS INDEED NEVER REALLY CROSS WITH HER. THE VERYSIGHT OF HER SEEMED TO CHARM AWAY HIS ILLHUMOUR AND HE WAS AT HISBEST WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT. IN SPITE OF THE STRAIN TO WHICH IT WAS OFTENSUBJECTED ALDYTH HAD A GENUINE AFFECTION FOR HER GRANDUNCLE ANDNEVER FAILED TO SHOW HIM THE TENDER REVERENCE YOUTH OWES TO AGE SO ITWAS LITTLE WONDER SHE EXERCISED A SOFTENING INFLUENCE ON HIM.THE MORNING WAS CLEAR AND COLD. A SILVERY RIME SPARKLED ON THE GRASSAND ON THE BARE BOUGHS OF THE TREES THE POND WAS FROZEN SO HARD THATSKATING SEEMED A NEAR POSSIBILITY THE TAME BIRDS FLUTTERED TO AND FROBEFORE THE HOUSE EAGERLY PICKING UP THE CRUMBS SCATTERED FOR THEM ONTHE HARD GLITTERING GRAVEL. IT WAS JUST THE MORNING FOR A WALK AND ATA HINT FROM HER UNCLE ALDYTH RAN TO PUT ON HER STRONG BOOTS AND THECOSY SEALSKIN JACKET AND CAP WHICH HAD BEEN HIS PRESENT TO HER ON THEPREVIOUS CHRISTMAS.OLD STEPHEN FRESH AND RUDDY DESPITE HIS FOURSCORE YEARS MINDED THECOLD NO MORE THAN A YOUNG MAN. FOLLOWED BY HIS DOGS HE MADE THE ROUNDOF THE GROUNDS WITH ALDYTH INSPECTED THE STABLES AND VISITED THESTACKYARD AND FARM BUILDINGS WHICH WERE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THEHALL. SHE ASKED QUESTIONS WHICH DREW FORTH LONG EXPLANATIONS FROM HIMHE POINTED OUT SUNDRY IMPROVEMENTS HE INTENDED MAKING TALKING OF HISPLANS WITH THE FREEDOM OF ONE WHO KNOWS HE HAS AN INTERESTED LISTENER.HE TOLD ALDYTH MUCH THAT SHE HAD HEARD BEFORE BUT SHE WAS WILLING TOLISTEN TO IT AGAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN HE BEGAN TO GO BACK AS OLD MENARE WONT TO DO TO HIS EARLY DAYS AND TELL HER TALES OF HIS BOYHOODMINGLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF THE MOTHER WHOM IT WAS EVIDENT HE HADTENDERLY LOVED.THE OLD PLACE LOOKS WELL TODAY HE REMARKED AS RETURNING BY A SIDEWALK THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY THEY CAME IN VIEW OF THE HOUSE SHINING INTHE FULL RADIANCE OF THE MORNING SUN THERE CAN BE NO PLACE LIKE ITFOR ME.

ALDYTH I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE YOUR NAME. I HAVE ALWAYSLOOKED FORWARD TO YOUR MAKING YOUR HOME AT WYNDHAM SOME DAY.ALDYTH COLOURED HOTLY. LISTENING TO TALK OF THE KIND FAMILIAR TO HERFROM HER UNCLE SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER DREAD OF HIS TOUCHING UPON THISSUBJECT. SHE LONGED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTANDHOW IMPOSSIBLE WAS THE IDEA HE CHERISHED BUT NO SUITABLE WORDSSUGGESTED THEMSELVES.THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE BY ONE OF THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS WHICH STOODOPEN.

SOMEHOW ONLY A WOMAN SEEMSTO UNDERSTAND WHAT A ROOM REQUIRES TO MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT. AND THERE HASBEEN NO MISTRESS AT WYNDHAM SINCE SHE PASSED AWAY AND THATS NIGH UPONFIFTY YEARS NOW.HE POINTED AS HE SPOKE TO THE PORTRAIT OF HIS MOTHER HANGING ABOVETHE MANTELSHELFA HANDSOME MOTHERLY WOMAN IN THE HIGH MOBCAP ANDSNOWY KERCHIEF WORN BY MATRONS OF HER DAY.

MY WISH IS ONLY FOR YOURHAPPINESS.I KNOW UNCLE I KNOW ALDYTH BEGAN BUTHE CHECKED HER WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE AND HURRIED OUT INTO THEHALL AS THOUGH DETERMINED NOT TO HEAR HER WORDS.ALDYTH LINGERED FOR A FEW MOMENTS BY THE DRAWING ROOM FIRE FEELINGBAFFLED AND HELPLESS. HER UNCLES IDEAS OF WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR HER OFWHAT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPINESS DIFFERED WIDELY FROM HER OWN. HOW COULDSHE MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WAS IT NOT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WHOSELIFE HAD LACKED THE MOST TENDER TIES AND INTO WHICH AS FAR AS SHEKNEW NO ROMANCE HAD ENTERED SHOULD COMPREHEND HOW SACRED A THINGMARRIAGE APPEARED TO HER AND HOW SHE DARE NOT DESECRATE THE HIGHESTINSTINCTS OF HER WOMANHOOD BY JOINING HERSELF BY THAT CLOSEST OF ALLBONDS TO ONE WHO COULD NEVER WIN HER SUPREME LOVEBUT STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD GONE AWAY SATISFIED THAT HIS WORDS WOULD NOTFAIL TO HAVE THE EFFECT HE DESIRED.SHE IS ALL RIGHT HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE DOES NOT MEAN TO GIVEHERSELF TO GUY TOO EASILY THAT IS ALL. IT IS HIS OWN FAULT THAT HE HASFAILED. OF COURSE SHE SEES THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ENOUGH ABOUT HER. BUTILL FIND MEANS TO MAKE HIM CARE ILL BRING HIM TO BOOK SOMEHOW.AND THE OLD MAN PONDERED FRESH PLANS CONVINCED THAT HIS BLUNDERINGEFFORTS AT MATCHMAKING WOULD BE CROWNED AT LAST WITH SUCCESS.LATER IN THE DAY AT HER UNCLES SUGGESTION ALDYTH TOOK RIDE WITH HERCOUSIN AND HIS FRIEND. ASSUREDLY THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PERSON WASNEVER FOUND MORE CONVENIENT. CAPTAIN WALKER WAS BENT ON MAKING HIMSELFAGREEABLE AND SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT GUYS UNUSUAL MOODINESS DID NOTSPOIL THE PLEASURE OF THE RIDE. PANSY WAS SO EXHILARATED BY THE KEENAIR THAT IT WAS ALL HER MISTRESS COULD DO TO RESTRAIN HER SPORTIVENESSAND IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE EXERCISE ALDYTH FORGOT EVERY CAUSE OFUNEASINESS.BUT TROUBLED THOUGHTS RETURNED TO HER.

HE DESIRES IT SO MUCH THAT FOR HIS SAKE I ALMOSTWISH IT WERE POSSIBLE.MISS LORRAINE SIGHED. VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE AFFAIR PRESENTEDTHEMSELVES TO HER WHICH NEVER ENTERED INTO ALDYTHS THOUGHTS. SHEWONDERED WHETHER THE GIRLS MOTHER WOULD APPROVE OF THE DECISION TOWHICH SHE HAD COME. TO ALDYTH THE QUESTION WAS PERFECTLY SIMPLE ANDIT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER AS POSSIBLE THAT HER MOTHERS OPINION ON THESUBJECT MIGHT NOT COINCIDE WITH HER OWN.CHAPTER XII.MR. LORRAINE SENDS FOR HIS SOLICITOR.IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR. A THAW HAD SET IN AND DISAPPOINTEDTHE SKATERS BUT NOW THE GROUND WAS AGAIN HARD WITH FROST AND A COLDGREY SKY SEEMED TO PRESAGE SNOW. EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON ALDYTH WENTDOWN TO THE BRANDS TO SEE IF THE GIRLS WERE INCLINED FOR A WALK BUTFOUND NEITHER OF THEM AT HOME SO AFTER A BRIEF CHAT WITH THEIR MOTHERSHE STARTED ALONE AND TURNING INTO THE TOLLESHUNT ROAD SET OFF FOR ABRISK WALK.IT WAS VERY COLD BUT TO ALDYTHS VIGOROUS YOUNG FRAME THE COLDBROUGHT ONLY ENJOYMENT. SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO TAKE A SOLITARY WALK. THECLOSE OF THE YEAR GAVE HER MUCH TO THINK ABOUT. SHE LIKED TO LOOK BACKOVER ITS MONTHS AND RECALL ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED. THERE WAS PLEASURETOO IN CONJECTURING AS TO THE COMING YEAR FOR ALDYTHS PAST HAD KNOWNNO SHADOWS THAT COULD MAKE HER LOOK FORWARD WITH DREAD TO THE UNKNOWNFUTURE. SHE DID NOT CHERISH MELANCHOLY THOUGHTS AND INDULGE IN GLOOMYIMAGINATIONS LIKE HILDA BLAND. ALDYTHS INNER LIFE WAS HEALTHY ANDGLAD. SHE DID NOT MAGNIFY HER GIRLHOODS TRIALS NOR BROOD OVER PASTVEXATIONS. ALREADY SHE COULD SMILE AT GUYS FOLLY ON HILDAS BIRTHDAYNIGHT AND PERSUADE HERSELF THAT HER GRANDUNCLE WOULD SOON LEARN HOWUNREASONABLE WAS HIS EXPECTATION WITH REGARD TO HER. IT WAS NOT IN THEPOWER OF SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TO DEPRESS HER LONG.THEY SEEMED OF SUCH SLIGHT MOMENT IN COMPARISON WITH ALL THE BEAUTIFULTHINGS OF LIFE WHICH FOR HER HAD STILL THE GLORY AND THE FRESHNESSOF A DREAM. IT WAS BY VIRTUE OF HER CHILDLIKE JOY IN LIFE THAT ALDYTHHELPED TO MAKE LIFE BEAUTIFUL TO OTHERS WHO SCARCELY KNEW TO WHAT THEYSHOULD ASCRIBE THE CHARM THEY FOUND IN HER SWEET GENIAL PRESENCE.ALDYTHS MIND IN ITS RETROSPECTION HAD TRAVELLED ALONG THE YEAR TOTHE TIME OF JOHN GLYNNES COMING TO WOODHAM. SHE WAS RECALLING HERANNOYANCE AT HAVING TO GIVE UP THE LECTURES WHEN RAISING HER EYESSHE PERCEIVED THE LECTURER WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER. SHE SMILEDINVOLUNTARILY. IT SEEMED SO STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR AT THATMOMENT.MR. GLYNNE HAD SEVERAL BOYS WITH HIM CHARLIE BLAND AMONGST THE NUMBERAND THEY SEEMED TO HAVE HAD A LONG TRAMP IN THE COUNTRY. HE WAS A GREATFAVOURITE WITH HIS PUPILS AND EVEN IN THE HOLIDAYS THEY GATHERED ABOUTHIM. IT WAS BY NO LAXITY OF RULE THAT HE HAD WON THEIR LIKING FOR HEHAD THE CHARACTER OF BEING THE STRICTEST OF ALL THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLMASTERS. IN NO OTHER CLASS WAS SUCH PERFECT DISCIPLINE MAINTAINED AS INHIS. A LOOK OR AT MOST A WORD FROM HIM WAS SUFFICIENT TO CHECK ALLUNRULINESS. THE BOYS KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH FOR JOHNGLYNNE HAD THE STERNNESS WHICH IN A STRONG CHARACTER COUNTERBALANCESGENTLENESS AND GOODNESS OF HEART. NO ONE COULD BE MORE SEVERE WHEN THEOCCASION WAS ONE WHICH DEMANDED SEVERITY. THE BOY DETECTED IN CRAMMINGOR SHAMMING WAS LIKELY TO RECEIVE A LESSON HE WOULD NOT SOON FORGET.JOHN GLYNNE MET ALDYTHS RECOGNITION WITH ONE OF THE FULL SWEET SMILESWHICH GAVE TO HIS FACE HOMELY ENOUGH OTHERWISE A RARE ATTRACTION. HEPAUSED TO SPEAK TO HER AND THE BOYS TROOPED ON ALL EXCEPT CHARLIEBLAND WHO FELT AS IF ALDYTH BELONGED TO HIM AND HE HAD A RIGHT TOLINGER BY HER SIDE.I AM GLAD TO MEET YOU MISS LORRAINE HE SAID. I WAS THINKING OFDROPPING IN PRESENTLY TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR AUNT. I AM GOING UP TOTOWN BY THE FIVE OCLOCK TRAIN.OH ARE YOU REALLY GOING HOME SAID ALDYTH. THEN YOUR SISTER ISBETTERSHE PRONOUNCES HERSELF QUITE WELL NOW. SHE WAS TO RETURN WITH MYMOTHER FROM BRIGHTON THIS MORNING. THE HOUSE IS READY SO WE MEET AGAINAS A UNITED FAMILY TONIGHT TO BEGIN THE NEW YEAR TOGETHER.OH THAT IS NICE SAID ALDYTH HEARTILY I AM VERY GLAD YOUR SISTERIS ALL RIGHT AGAIN. YOU KNOW I FEEL AS IF I KNEW HER ALTHOUGH WE HAVENEVER MET.I WISH VERY MUCH THAT SHE COULD MEET YOU SAID JOHN GLYNNEEARNESTLY I AM SURE YOU TWO WOULD BE FRIENDS. WELL I MUST SAYGOODBYE MISS LORRAINE THOUGH NOT FOR LONG. WE SHALL SOON BE AT WORKAGAIN EH CHARLIECHARLIE MADE SUCH A COMICAL GRIMACE THAT ALDYTH LAUGHED.THAT IS NOT A PLEASANT ANTICIPATION FOR CHARLIE I AM AFRAID SHESAID. DO NOT TROUBLE TO CALL ON AUNT MR. GLYNNE YOU WOULD NOT FINDHER AT HOME.NO THEN I MUST ASK YOU TO TELL HER OF MY INTENTION. GOODBYE MISSALDYTH I WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR.THANK YOU SAID ALDYTH. AND I WISH YOU AND YOUR MOTHER AND SISTERTHE SAME. SOMEHOW I THINK IT MUST BE A HAPPY NEW YEAR.FOR YOU NO DOUBT HE REPLIED LOOKING A LITTLE ENVIOUSLY AT THEGIRLS GLAD FACE GLOWING WITH HEALTH AND HAPPINESS. YOU HAVE A BRIGHTPROSPECT BEFORE YOU.OH I DONT KNOW SAID ALDYTH A LITTLE SIGH ESCAPING AS SHE SPOKE.I BEGIN EVERY YEAR WITH HOPETHE HOPE THAT IT WILL BRING MY MOTHERHOME TO ME. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SHE WILL SURELY COME NEXT YEAR BUTI MAY BE DISAPPOINTED AGAIN. YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO BESEPARATED FROM YOUR MOTHER ALL YOUR LIFE.NO I CANNOT HE SAID HIS TONE FULL OF SYMPATHY. IT MUST BE HARD. IDO HOPE THE NEW YEAR WILL BRING YOU THE GREAT JOY OF HER RETURN.ALDYTH SMILED BUT HER EYES GREW MOIST. THE VERY THOUGHT OF THAT JOYAFFECTED HER LIKE PAIN.IT IS A PITY YOU ARE GOING AWAY JUST AS THERE IS A CHANCE OF SOMESKATING REMARKED CHARLIE TO HIS TUTOR AS THEY WALKED ON. YOU SHOULDSEE ALDYTH SKATE. I THINK SHE IS AS CLEVER ON HER SKATES AS KITTYTHOUGH EVERY ONE SAYS KITTY IS THE BEST GIRL SKATER AT WOODHAM. GUYWAS TRYING TO TEACH HILDA LAST WINTER BUT SHE IS A DUFFER SHE IS TOOAFRAID OF FALLING TO DO ANYTHING.GLYNNE SCARCELY HEARD HIS WORDS. HE WAS LOST IN THOUGHT. SURELY ITWAS MORE THAN THE HOPE OF HER MOTHERS RETURN WHICH MADE ALDYTHLORRAINE SPEAK SO CONFIDENTLY OF A HAPPY NEW YEAR. WELL GUY LORRAINEWAS A HAPPY FELLOW. IF ONLY HE HAD SEEMED A LITTLE MORE CAPABLE OFAPPRECIATING THE TREASURE HE HAD WONFINDING HIS REMARKS MET WITH NO ATTENTION CHARLIE RAN ON TO OVERTAKETHE OTHER BOYS. HIS COMPANY WAS NOT MISSED. JOHN GLYNNE WALKED SLOWLYAND HIS VACANT GLANCE TOOK NO NOTICE OF TWO PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE SEENCOMING ALONG A NARROW LANE WHICH RAN BETWEEN THE FIELDS AND LED FROMTHE LONDON ROAD TO THE TOLLESHUNT ROAD. IN SUMMER THE OVERHANGINGTREES MADE THE NARROW WALK DELIGHTFULLY SHADY AND WILD FLOWERS GREWLUXURIANTLY ON EITHER SIDE BUT NOW WHEN THE TREES WERE BARE ANDNOT A FLOWER TO BE SEEN THE LANE HAD NO ATTRACTION SAVE SUCH AS ITSLONELINESS OFFERED.GLYNNE RECEIVED AN IMPRESSION THAT THE TWO WALKING THERE MUST BELOVERS BUT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE TALL SQUARELYBUILT FORM NORTHE PETITE GIRLISH FIGURE WHICH WAS SUCH AN EXTREME CONTRAST TO ITSHEIGHT AND STRENGTH. HE COULD NOT SUPPOSE IT TO BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCETO HIM WHO THE TWO WERE WHO FOUND SUCH PLEASURE IN EACH OTHERS SOCIETY.BUT A PAIR OF EYES VERY MUCH ON THE ALERT TO MARK ALL THAT PASSEDBEFORE THEM HAD OBSERVED THE TWO AT THE OTHER END OF THE LANE ERE THEYPASSED INTO ITS SHELTER. GUY HAD BEEN FAR FROM THINKING WHEN HE ASKEDHILDA TO MEET HIM AT WOOD CORNER THAT AFTERNOON THAT HIS UNCLE WASLIKELY TO BE ANYWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD. BUT STEPHEN LORRAINE OWNEDA FARM NOT FAR FROM WOOD CORNER AND DRIVING HOMEWARDS FROM ANOTHERDIRECTION HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS TENANT HAD SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUTREPAIRS. NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT HE DECIDED THOUGH TO CALL AT THEFARM WOULD TAKE HIM SEVERAL MILES OUT OF HIS WAY.THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE LONDON ROAD NEAR THESPOT WHERE GUY AND HILDA HAD MET. HE WAS QUICK TO RECOGNIZE THE TALLHANDSOME FORM OF HIS NEPHEW AND THE DIMINUTIVE SIZE OF HIS COMPANIONREVEALED HER IDENTITY. AS SOON AS GUY PERCEIVED HIS UNCLES GIG COMINGALONG HE TRIED TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION BY HURRYING DOWN THE LANE ANACTION WHICH INCREASED HIS UNCLES DISPLEASURE.WHAT MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR A CHANCE MEETING HAD THUS THE APPEARANCE OFA CLANDESTINE APPOINTMENT.LITTLE MINX WHY DOES NOT HER MOTHER LOOK AFTER HER HE SAID TOHIMSELF. WELL ILL LET HER KNOW AND SHE SHALL HEAR MY MIND ON THESUBJECT TOO.STRAIGHT DOWN WOODHAM HE SAID TO THE SERVANT WHO WAS DRIVING. IHAVE A CALL TO MAKE THERE.GUY REACHED HOME BEFORE HIS UNCLE WHO ARRIVED LATE FOR DINNER AFTERPAYING MRS. BLAND A VISIT THAT HAD GREATLY ASTONISHED AND DISTURBEDHER. IT WAS WITH SOME UNEASINESS THAT THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIS PLACE ATTHE TABLE. HE HAD TRIED HARD TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLEHIS UNCLE COULD HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM THAT AFTERNOON BUT HE HAD NOTSUCCEEDED IN DISMISSING EVERY FEAR. HIS UNCLES BEARING AFFORDED HIM NOSURE GROUND OF CONFIDENCE.THE OLD MAN ATE HIS DINNER IN GRIM SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY BRIEF BUTCAUSTIC REJOINDERS TO THE FEW REMARKS ON WHICH GUY VENTURED. HE WASOBVIOUSLY IN AN UNAMIABLE MOOD BUT A VARIETY OF CAUSES MIGHT HAVECONDUCED TO THAT NOT INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE. GUY ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVEHIMSELF CIRCUMSPECTLY AND AVOID EVERY REFERENCE LIKELY TO FAN THESMOULDERING FLAME. HE SEEMED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED AND IT WAS WITH RISINGSPIRITS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE DINING ROOM WHEN A WORD FROMHIS UNCLE STAYED HIM.HAVE YOU ANY ENGAGEMENT FOR TOMORROW MORNING GUYNO SIR I HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR IN HAND TOMORROW.THEN I WILL TROUBLE YOU TO RIDE TO WOODHAM FOR ME THE FIRST THING.

THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF MAKING HER THE MISTRESS OFWYNDHAM AND MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM I INTEND THAT SHE SHALL BE.GUY FLUSHED AND THEN PALED. THIS REVELATION OF HIS UNCLES INTENTIONSWAS A SHOCK TO HIM. BUT HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND AFTER WAITING FOR AFEW MOMENTS TO SEE IF HIS UNCLE HAD MORE TO SAY QUIETLY LEFT THE ROOM.THE TWO BREAKFASTED TOGETHER THE NEXT MORNING AS USUAL. IT WAS NOT APLEASANT DAY FOR A RIDE. IT HAD BEEN SNOWING IN THE NIGHT AND A SPARSEWHITE COVERING LAY ON THE GROUND EVERY NOW AND THEN THE KEEN NORTHWIND WOULD BRING A SHOWER OF SLEET. NEITHER OF THE GENTLEMEN HOWEVERREMARKED UPON THE WEATHER AS THEY TOOK THEIR BREAKFAST. THE SQUIRE GAVEHIS WHOLE ATTENTION TO THE TIMES AND GUY OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH ASPORTING JOURNAL AND WITH A FAVOURITE DOG THAT SAT BEGGING BY HISSIDE AND SHARED HIS MEAL.ON RISING FROM THE TABLE STEPHEN LORRAINE WENT TO HIS DESK. GUYWATCHED HIM AS HE SELECTED A SHEET OF NOTEPAPER AND THEN BEGAN TO WRITEIN HIS SMALL NEAT HAND.

YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT IT ISAFTER SO MANY YEARS TO KNOWTHAT MY MOTHER IS COMING TO ME.I SUPPOSE NOT SAID MISS LORRAINE DRILY. WELL CHILD I AM GLADTHAT YOU ARE SO PLEASED.BUT AS SHE SPOKE HER FACE HAD A WISTFUL PAINED EXPRESSION. ALDYTHSINCE HER BABYHOOD HAD BEEN HER CARE AND THE FEELINGS OF A MOTHERHAD GROWN UP IN HER HEART TOWARDS THE CHILD SHE HAD CHERISHED. COULDELEANOR STANTON SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH BE SO MUCHMORE TO ALDYTH THAN THE AUNT WHO HAD COMFORTED HER CHILDISH SORROWS ANDNURSED HER THROUGH ALL HER CHILDISH AILMENTS WOULD SHE BE AS LIKELY TOUNDERSTAND THE GIRL MISS LORRAINE FELT AGGRIEVED BY THE EMOTION ALDYTHDISPLAYED EVEN WHILST SHE TOLD HERSELF IT WAS WRONG AND UNREASONABLETO FEEL SO.BUT ALDYTH THRILLED AND EXCITED HAD NO THOUGHTS TO SPARE FOR HERAUNT AND FAILED TO SEE THAT SHE WAS HURT.AND MISS LORRAINE WAS THANKFUL THAT FOR ONCE HER NIECE WAS SOUNOBSERVANT.CHAPTER XIV.A LONGDEFERRED HOPE IS REALIZED.A FORTNIGHT LATER ON A RAW GLOOMY AFTERNOON ALDYTH AND HER AUNTSTEPPED FROM A TRAIN ON TO THE PLATFORM OF LIVERPOOL STREET STATION. ATELEGRAM RECEIVED LATE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD ACQUAINTED THEM WITHTHE FACT THAT THE STANTON FAMILY HAD ARRIVED IN LONDON AND ALDYTH WASNOW ON HER WAY TO MEET HER MOTHER.ALDYTHS FACE WAS WHITE AND EAGER AND MISS LORRAINE TOO LOOKEDEXCITED. ALDYTH HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO MAINTAIN SILENCE ALL THE WAY ANDTHE JOURNEY HAD NEVER SEEMED TO HER SO TEDIOUS BUT EXCITEMENT HAD HADTHE CONTRARY EFFECT ON HER AUNT. UNCHECKED BY HER NIECES RELUCTANTREJOINDERS SHE HAD TALKED THE WHOLE TIME CHIEFLY ON MATTERS OF LITTLEOR NO IMPORTANCE. BUT WHEN THEY WERE IN A CAB DRIVING TO THE WESTENDHOTEL WHERE THE STANTONS WERE TO BE FOUND MISS LORRAINE TOO BECAMESILENT AND HER EYES WERE OFTEN TURNED UPON HER NIECE WITH A RATHERANXIOUS EXPRESSION.IT WAS NO NEW THING TO ALDYTH TO BE IN LONDON. SHE AND HER AUNT NOTSELDOM CAME UP FOR A DAYS SHOPPING IN TOWN OR GAVE THEMSELVES AFEW DAYS ENJOYMENT OF SIGHTSEEING. THEY FOUND SUCH DELIGHT IN THEPLEASURES OF TOWN AS ONLY COUNTRY PEOPLE CAN TO WHOSE ORDINARYEXPERIENCE IT OFFERS SO SHARP A CONTRAST.BUT TODAY ALDYTH HAD NO EYES FOR THE SHOP WINDOWS NOR FOR THEBEAUTIFUL EQUIPAGES THEY MET AS THEY DROVE WESTWARDS. SHE SAW NOTHINGTHAT THEY PASSED. THERE WAS A STRANGE COMBINATION OF THOUGHTSIFTHOUGHTS THEY COULD BE CALLEDIN HER HEART. EVERY NOW AND THEN TEARSWOULD RISE TO HER EYES AS SHE TOLD HERSELF HOW HAPPY SHE WAS GOING TOBE. LIFE MUST BE DIFFERENT FOR HER FROM HENCEFORTH. ALL SHE HAD KNOWNOR READ OR DREAMED OF A MOTHERS LOVE WAS TO BE REALIZED AT LAST. SHESTARTED AS FROM A DREAM AND FLUSHED CRIMSON WHEN HER AUNT SUDDENLY LAIDHER HAND ON HER ARM.WE ARE ALMOST THERE ALDYTH. SEE THIS IS CHARING CROSS.AND STILL WITH A DREAMY SENSE OF UNREALITY ALDYTH RECOGNIZED THEWIDE SPACE BEFORE HER THE FOUNTAINS THE LIONS THE STATUES WITH THEOMNIBUSES TAKING UP PASSENGERS THE CARRIAGES DASHING TO AND FRO ANDALL THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF LONDON LIFE.OH ALDYTH OH MY DEAR CHILD SAID MISS LORRAINE TAKING THE GIRLSHAND IN HERS AND SPEAKING IN AGITATED TONES.ALDYTH LOOKED AT HER WONDERINGLY BUT WHATEVER MISS LORRAINE WAS ABOUTTO SAYIF INDEED SHE KNEWWAS NEVER SAID.THEIR CAB WAS MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH A CROWD OF VEHICLES. THERE WAS ABUMP AND A JAR WHICH STARTLED MISS LORRAINE ALWAYS SOMEWHAT NERVOUSWHEN DRIVING IN LONDON. HAPPILY THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM ALL WASRIGHT IN A MOMENT. BUT ERE MISS LORRAINE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER FRIGHTTHEY WERE AT THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AN OBSEQUIOUS SERVANT STOODREADY TO HELP THEM TO ALIGHT.ALDYTH MADE AN EFFORT TO SUBDUE HER EXCITEMENT AS THEY FOLLOWED AWAITER UP THE STEPS BUT IN SPITE OF HER WILL HER HEART BEAT UNEASILYAND SHE FELT QUITE FAINT AS THE MAN THREW OPEN A DOOR AND ANNOUNCEDTHEM. SHE NEED NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY NERVOUSNESS HOWEVER. THEROOM THEY ENTERED WAS A LARGE ONE WITH THREE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THEEMBANKMENT AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARED TO BE EMPTY BUT A YOUNGLADY ROSE HASTILY FROM THE DEPTHS OF A GREAT EASYCHAIR BY THE FIREAND CAME FORWARD WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND.ALDYTH DO WE MEET AT LAST SHE SAID AND KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY.HOW STRANGE IT IS TO THINK THAT YOU ARE MY SISTER AND WE HAVE NEVERSEEN EACH OTHER TILL NOW AND THIS IS YOUR AUNT I SUPPOSE HOW DO YOUDO MISS LORRAINE I CANNOT CLAIM YOU AS AN AUNT ALTHOUGH ALDYTH IS MYSISTER. PRAY COME NEAR THE FIRE YOU MUST BE DREADFULLY COLD. I NEVERKNEW ANYTHING LIKE THE COLD OF LONDON.ALDYTH SAT DOWN BUT HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE DOOR WHICHCOMMUNICATED WITH THE NEXT ROOM. WAS HER MOTHER THERE WHY DID SHE NOTCOME TO HERYOU ARE GLADYS I SUPPOSE SAID MISS LORRAINE PITYING ALDYTHSSUSPENSE. MRS. STANTON IS QUITE WELL I HOPEOH PERFECTLY WELL THANK YOU SAID GLADYS. SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVEHERSELF FOR NOT BEING HERE TO WELCOME ALDYTH BUT PAPA WANTED HER TO GOOUT WITH HIM. I THINK THEY WERE GOING TO INQUIRE ABOUT A HOUSE AND OFCOURSE WE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHEN YOU WOULD ARRIVE. BUT MAMMA WILL BEVERY VEXED.ALDYTH SAID NOTHING. SHE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN WITHOUT BETRAYING HOWDISAPPOINTED SHE WAS. ALL THE WAY TO LONDON SHE HAD HAD A VISION OF HERMOTHER AWAITING HER EAGER FOR HER COMING LONGING TO CLASP HER IN HERARMS. THIS REALITY WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER ANTICIPATIONS THAT SHEEXPERIENCED A PAINFUL REVULSION OF FEELING.DO COME NEARER THE FIRE SAID GLADYS STANTON SEEING HER TURN PALEAND SHIVER. AND YOU WILL LIKE SOME TEATEA IS ALWAYS REFRESHING AFTERA JOURNEY. SHE ROSE AND RANG THE BELL AS SHE SPOKE.ALDYTH NOW LOOKED MORE ATTENTIVELY AT HER SISTER. SHE WAS VERY FAIRWITH LARGE BLUE EYES AND AN ABUNDANCE OF PALE SILKY HAIR TWISTED INA SORT OF PICTURESQUE CONFUSION ABOUT HER HEAD. HER TALL WILLOWY FORMWAS ALMOST TOO SLIM BUT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO WATCH ITS EASY GRACEFULMOVEMENTS. THE SMALL OVAL FACE FRAMED BY THE MASSES OF BRIGHT HAIRHAD FAULTY FEATURES BUT ITS EXPRESSION WAS WINSOME AND THE LONGBLUE EYES HAD A WAY OF LOOKING AND THE MOUTH A TRICK OF SMILING THEFASCINATION OF WHICH ALDYTH SOON BEGAN TO FEEL.WHEN THE WAITER APPEARED SHE ORDERED TEA AND THEN INQUIRED WHERE THELADIES ROOMS WERE AND IF THEIR LUGGAGE HAD BEEN TAKEN UP.DID THE LADIES WANT ROOMS IN THE HOTEL ASKED THE MAN WITH AN AIROF SURPRISE. I AM AFRAID THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE I BELIEVE EVERY ROOM ISTAKEN.OH NO THAT CANNOT BE SAID GLADYS MRS. STANTON HAS ENGAGED THEROOMS. YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE. PLEASE GO AND INQUIRE ABOUT THEM.OF COURSE HE MUST BE MISTAKEN SHE SAID WHEN HE HAD GONE. I KNOWMAMMA MEANT TO ENGAGE ROOMS FOR YOU.BUT WHEN THE WAITER REAPPEARED WITH THE TEA HE BROUGHT WORD THAT THEREWERE INDEED NO ROOMS TO BE HAD. THE CLERK DECLARED THAT NO EXTRA ROOMSHAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR MRS. STANTONS PARTY.OH DEAR THEN MAMMA MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN IT. HOW TIRESOME OF HERSAID GLADYS. WHAT WILL YOU THINK OF US SHE ADDED TURNING WITHA PRETTY DEPRECATING AIR TO ALDYTH. BUT YOU KNOW WE ONLY ARRIVEDYESTERDAY AND MAMMA HAS HAD SO MUCH TO THINK OF. SHE LOST ONE OF HERTRUNKS TOO AND THAT HAS PUT HER OUT VERY MUCH. WHAT IS TO BE DONENOW I WONDERWE MUST GO TO ANOTHER HOTEL OF COURSE SAID MISS LORRAINE PROMPTLYTHERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD.HERE THE WAITER INTERPOSED AND SAID THAT THE LADIES COULD HAVE ROOMSIN A PRIVATE HOTEL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.OH THAT MIGHT DO SAID GLADYS AS SHE POURED OUT THE TEA YOU WOULDBE CLOSE BY AND COULD BE WITH US ALL THE TIME. WOULD YOU MIND THAT SOVERY MUCHNOT AT ALL WE SHOULD DO VERY WELL THERE SAID ALDYTH WHO BY THISTIME HAD CONQUERED HER WOUNDED FEELINGS AND REGAINED SELFCONTROL.WE MUST SEE THE ROOMS BEFORE WE AGREE TO TAKE THEM SAID GLADYSPROMPTLY WITH A BUSINESSLIKE AIR. NOW DO DRINK YOUR TEA WHILST IT ISHOT AND THEN I WILL GO ACROSS WITH YOU AND SEE IF THE PLACE IS FIT FORYOU.ALDYTH WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MUCH INTERESTED IN HER PRETTY SISTER.THERE WAS SOMETHING SURPRISING TO HER IN THE SELFPOSSESSION ANDSAVOIRFAIRE OF THIS GIRL OF NINETEEN. SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED THATGLADYS WAS OLDER THAN HERSELF FOR GLADYS RICH DRESS AND THE JEWELLERYWITH WHICH HER PERSON WAS LAVISHLY ADORNED GAVE HER A MATURE AIR. HERGOWN OF RUBY SILK WAS MORE GORGEOUS THAN ANYTHING ALDYTH EVER WORE ANDHAD SHE POSSESSED SUCH A ONE SHE WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT ONLY SUITABLEFOR A DINNER OR EVENING PARTY.ALDYTH WAS STILL ON THE WATCH FOR HER MOTHERS ARRIVAL BUT GLADYS DIDNOT APPEAR TO EXPECT HER IMMEDIATE RETURN.WE ARE TO DINE HERE AT SEVEN AS A FAMILY PARTY SHE SAID GLANCINGROUND THE ROOM. MAMMA THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICER THAN GOING TO THETABLE DHTE TONIGHT. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO TO YOUR ROOMS NOWYOU WOULD WISH TO CHANGE YOUR DRESS I DARE SAYNOT BUT WHAT YOU LOOKAS NICE AS POSSIBLE.MISS LORRAINE ASSENTED WITH SOME EAGERNESS. SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEASSURED OF COMFORTABLE QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE IT GREW LATER.GLADYS CAUGHT UP A HANDSOME TRAVELLING CLOAK AND A LARGE HAT WITHDROOPING FEATHERS WHICH LAY ON A CHAIR HASTILY ARRAYED HERSELF INTHEM THRUST HER JEWELLED FINGERS INTO A TINY MUFF AND DECLAREDHERSELF READY TO ACCOMPANY HER VISITORS. THEY HAD BUT TO WALK A FEWSTEPS ACROSS THE STREET AND THEY WERE IN THE OTHER HOUSE.THE ROOMS WERE VERY NICE. GLADYS FOUND SOME FAULT WITH THEM PERHAPSBECAUSE SHE FELT DUTY BOUND NOT TO BE TOO EASILY SATISFIED ON BEHALFOF HER FRIENDS. SHE LINGERED FOR A WHILE OFFERING TO HELP ALDYTH TOUNPACK AND EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO ALL SHE COULD FOR HER NEWFOUNDSISTER.WHEN AT LAST ALDYTH ASSURED HER THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SHE COULD DOGLADYS THREW HER ARMS ABOUT HER A GAVE HER A LOVING LITTLE HUG AND KISS.I AM SURE I SHALL LIKE YOU SHE SAID IMPETUOUSLY. I AM SURE WESHALL GET ON WELL TOGETHER ALTHOUGH YOU ARE OLDER THAN I AM.I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT GET ON TOGETHERSAID ALDYTH HER HEART GOING OUT IN WARM RESPONSE TO THIS WELCOMEAFFECTION. YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR A SISTER. IT HASSEEMED SO HARD TO HAVE SISTERS WHOM I COULD NEVER SEE.OH I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED SAID GLADYS IMPRESSIVELY.I DO HOPE YOU HAVE NOT ROMANTIC IDEAS ABOUT SISTERLY AFFECTION FORIF SO I AM SURE WE SHALL SHOCK YOU SINCE NELL AND I ARE FOR EVERQUARRELLING. BUT NOW I WILL LEAVE YOU. BE SURE TO COME OVER AS SOON ASYOU ARE READY.SHE SEEMS A NICE GIRL ALTHOUGH SO OVERDRESSED SAID MISS LORRAINEPOPPING HER HEAD INTO ALDYTHS ROOM AS SOON AS HER SISTER HAD GONE IHOPE YOU WILL LIKE HER.I DO LIKE HER I AM SURE IT WILL BE EASY TO LOVE HER SAID ALDYTHWARMLY.I WISH YOU WOULD COME AND SEE IF YOU CAN OPEN THE REGISTER IN MYROOM SAID HER AUNT I FANCIED THE ROOM FELT STUFFY WHEN I ENTEREDAND NOW I FIND THAT THE CHIMNEY IS FAST CLOSED.ALDYTH WENT AT ONCE SOON HAD THE CHIMNEY OPEN AND RENDERED SEVERALOTHER LITTLE SERVICES TO HER AUNT. MISS LORRAINE REFRAINED FROM ANYCOMMENT ON THE FACT OF MRS. STANTON BEING ABSENT WHEN HER DAUGHTERARRIVED AND ALDYTH WAS GRATEFUL FOR HER SILENCE.WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER ROOM ALDYTH BOLTED HER DOOR SAT DOWN ANDBURST INTO TEARS. SHE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS NO DISGUISING THETRUTH THOUGH SHE TRIED TO PERSUADE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS UNREASONABLYDISAPPOINTED. IT WAS BUT TOO CLEAR THAT HER COMING WAS NOT TO HERMOTHER WHAT HER MOTHERS COMING WAS TO HER. AND HOW SHOULD IT BEALDYTH ASKED HERSELF TRYING HARD TO RALLY HER COMMON SENSE HAD NOTHER MOTHER THREE OTHER CHILDREN AND WAS THERE NOT FOR HER ALL THEEXCITEMENT OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND AFTER AN ABSENCE OF TWENTY YEARSAND YETAND YET ALDYTH COULD NOT ARGUE AWAY HER PAIN. SOMETHING WITHINHER HEART WOULD SAY THAT THEIR MEETING SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HERMOTHER THAN ALL BESIDE. THE ONE RAY OF PLEASURE THAT LIGHTENED ALDYTHSDISAPPOINTMENT CAME FROM THE KINDNESS OF HER SISTER GLADYS. THE WARMTHOF HER LOVING CARESS AND FRANK IMPULSIVE WORDS SEEMED TO REMAIN WITHALDYTH.ALDYTH DID NOT LONG GIVE WAY TO TEARS. SHE REMEMBERED THAT TIME WASPASSING AND THAT SHE MUST PREPARE FOR THE MEETING WITH HER MOTHER.SLOWLY AND WITH MORE DELIBERATION THAN SHE OFTEN BESTOWED ON IT SHEBEGAN TO MAKE HER TOILET. SHE TOOK DOWN AND SHOOK OUT HER LONG DARKHAIR BRUSHED IT TILL IT SHONE LIKE SATIN THEN COMBED IT STRAIGHT BACKFROM HER BROWS AND PLAITED IT INTO A BEAUTIFUL COIL AT THE BACK OF HERHEAD.AS SHE SURVEYED THE EFFECT SHE SMILED TO THINK WHAT A CONTRAST HERAPPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THAT OF GLADYS. I SHOULD FEEL SO UNTIDY IF IWORE MY HAIR IN SUCH A TANGLE SHE THOUGHT AND YET SHE LOOKS VERYPRETTY SO. I WONDER IF THAT IS AN AUSTRALIAN FASHION.WITH SOME ANXIETY ALDYTH PUT ON HER GOWNA SOFT GREY CASHMERE WITH AVEST OF PALE PINK. IT HAD WON MUCH ADMIRATION FROM HILDA BLAND BUT NOWALDYTH FELT DOUBTFUL ABOUT IT. SHE LOOKED WISTFULLY AT HERSELF IN THEMIRROR.SHALL I LOOK OLDFASHIONED BESIDE GLADYS SHE ASKED HERSELF. OH IDO HOPE MOTHER WILL LIKE THE LOOK OF ME.SHE SMILED AT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THOUGHT BUT WITH THE SMILE CAMETEARS. WERE NOT MOTHERS GENERALLY DISPOSED TO LIKE THEIR CHILDRENSLOOKSTHERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR AND SHE OPENED IT TO ADMIT HER AUNT. MISSLORRAINE WORE HER BEST BLACK SILK AND A DAINTY LITTLE HEADDRESS OFLACE.AH YOU ARE READY SHE SAID THEN WE HAD BETTER GO ACROSS. IT ISHALFPAST SIX.SHALL I DO AUNTIE ASKED ALDYTH ANXIOUSLY.DO YOU WILL ALWAYS DO CHILD SAID MISS LORRAINE PLAYFULLY. YESINDEED YOU LOOK VERY NICEFAR MORE SUITABLY DRESSED THAN GLADYS IN MYOPINION. AND SHE KISSED ALDYTH.AFTER ALL SHE TOLD HERSELF WITH SECRET PLEASURE ALDYTH WAS HER CHILDAND BELONGED TO HER FAR MORE TRULY THAN TO THAT STRANGE MOTHER JUSTCOME ACROSS THE SEA.ALDYTH WAS TREMBLING AGAIN AS SHE WENT UP THE STAIRS OF THE HOTEL.GLADYS MET THEM IN THE CORRIDOR TOOK MISS LORRAINE TO THEIR PRIVATESITTING ROOM BUT DREW ALDYTH BACK AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS THETHRESHOLD.COME WITH ME SHE SAID MAMMA HATES SCENES AND SHE WOULD RATHER SEEYOU ALONE FIRST. WE WILL GO TO HER ROOM.THEY PASSED ALONG THE CORRIDOR BUT ALDYTH WAS AWARE OF NOTHING TILL ADOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF A TALLAND HANDSOME LADY. THEN SHE HAD A MOMENTARY BEWILDERING SENSE THAT THEPHOTOGRAPH HAD DECEIVED HER AND THIS WAS NOT THE FORM SHE HAD IMAGEDTO HERSELF. BUT ERE SHE COULD RECEIVE ANY DISTINCT IMPRESSION THE LADYHAD FOLDED HER IN HER ARMS AND A VOICE EXQUISITELY SWEET AND FULLAND CARESSING SAID TENDERLYMY DEAR CHILD CAN IT INDEED BE MY LITTLE ALDYTH COME BACK TO ME LIKETHISFOR A FEW MOMENTS ALDYTH COULD NOT SPEAK. IT WAS LIKE A DREAMTHETENDER PRESSURE THE SOFT KISSES THE CARESSING TONES AND MINGLINGWITH THEM THE SUBTLE SWEET PERFUME THAT PERVADED HER MOTHERS DRESS.IN THAT BRIEF INTERVAL ALDYTH TASTED THE BLISS FOR WHICH SHE HADYEARNED. BUT THE NEXT MINUTE MRS. STANTONS ARMS LOOSENED THEIRCLASP SHE DREW BACK A STEP OR TWO AND STOOD LOOKING AT HER DAUGHTEREVIDENTLY AWAITING HER INSPECTION.ALDYTH LOOKED AT HER MOTHER WITH EAGER WONDERING EYES. SHE COULD SEEA LIKENESS TO THE PORTRAIT NOW BUT SHE SAW ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES.THE RICH WAVING HAIR ABUNDANT AS EVER WAS NOW SILVERY GREYA CHANGEWHICH GAVE A STRIKING EFFECT TO THE HANDSOME CLEARCUT FEATURES ANDTHE LARGE FLASHING DARK EYES WHICH HAD LOST LITTLE OF THE BRILLIANCYWHICH IN YOUTH HAD MADE THEM SO IRRESISTIBLE. FEW WOMEN OF HER YEARSCOULD HAVE BORNE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR ROLLED HIGH UP ABOVE THE BROWS ASHERS WAS BUT DESPITE HER GREY HAIR MRS. STANTON HAD NO LOOK OF AGE.HER CHEEKS WERE WELL ROUNDED HER COMPLEXION FRESH AND HER FULL REDLIPS CLOSED OVER PERFECT TEETH. SHE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A FULLBLOWNBEAUTY OF THE PERIOD WHEN IT WAS THE FASHION FOR LADIES TO POWDERTHEIR HAIR BY WAY OF ACCENTUATING THEIR BLOOM. HER FIGURE WAS FULLAND WELLFORMED AND THE DARING SIMPLICITY OF HER BLACK VELVET GOWNWITH SQUARECUT BODICE SHOWING THE ROUND WHITE THROAT SET IT OFF TOPERFECTION. HER BEAUTIFUL ARMS WERE BARE FROM THE ELBOW AND ADORNEDWITH HEAVY GOLD BRACELETS.A GLOW OF ADMIRATION MIGHT WELL KINDLE IN ALDYTHS EYES AS SHE OBSERVEDHER MOTHER.WELL SAID MRS. STANTON AT LAST NOT ILLPLEASED WITH THE EXPRESSIONSHE READ ON ALDYTHS FACE AM I AT ALL WHAT YOU EXPECTED WHAT DO YOUTHINK OF MEYOU ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED ALDYTH REPLIED SLOWLY IN A LOWFERVENT TONE BUTYOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL.MRS. STANTON LAUGHED. SHE WAS WELL PLEASED WITH HER DAUGHTERS SIMPLEINGENUOUS REMARK.AH YOU ARE A FLATTERER I FEAR SHE SAID LIGHTLY BUT REALLY YOURAPPEARANCE IS NOT ALTOGETHER FLATTERING. I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE SUCH AWOMAN. YOU MAKE ME FEEL QUITE OLD. LET ME SEEWHAT IS YOUR AGE BY THEBYI WAS TWENTYONE LAST MARCH SAID ALDYTH A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT HERMOTHER SHOULD NEED TO ASK.AH TO BE SURE I HAD FORGOTTEN SAID MRS. STANTON CARELESSLY ANDGLADYS IS JUST NINETEEN. BUT NOW MR. STANTON WILL BE IMPATIENT TO SEEYOU AND YOU HAVE YET TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF CECIL AND NELLY.COME DARLING.SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM.MR. STANTON DID NOT LOOK AS IF HE WERE IMPATIENT TO SEE ALDYTH OR ANYONE. HE WAS A WEARYLOOKING MAN WITH BALD HEAD AND STOOPING SHOULDERS.HIS MANNER WAS SINGULARLY NERVOUS AND SHY AND THOUGH HE GREETED ALDYTHNOT UNKINDLY HE SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO HER. BUT HIS WIFE WASWELL ABLE TO SUPPLY HIS LACK OF WORDS. SHE TALKED BOTH FOR HIM AND FORHERSELF.I HAVE BEEN TELLING ALDYTH HOW ANXIOUS YOU WERE TO SEE HER ROBERT.NOW IS SHE WHAT YOU EXPECTED NOT AT ALL LIKE ME IS SHE NO SHERESEMBLES HER FATHER. IT IS VERY STRANGE THAT NOT ONE OF MY GIRLS ISREALLY LIKE ME. GLADYS RESEMBLES ME MOST BUT THEN SHE IS FAIR LIKEYOUR FAMILY AND HER FEATURES ARE NOT LIKE MINE. I OFTEN WONDER HOWIT IS THAT PEOPLE WILL PERSIST IN SAYING SHE IS LIKE ME. OH HERE ISNELLY COME NELLY AND LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO YOUR SISTER ALDYTH.NELLY APPEARED BY NO MEANS DESIROUS OF THE INTRODUCTION. SHE WASA BIG AWKWARD GIRL OF FIFTEEN DARK HEAVYBROWED AND SOMEWHATSULLENLOOKING BUT WITH GOOD EYES AND A CERTAIN RESEMBLANCE TO HERHANDSOME MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS UNDENIABLY PLAIN. SHE SEEMED TO HAVEINHERITED HER FATHERS NERVOUS SHY MANNER. SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ALDYTHWITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND RUSHED AWAY TO THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOMWHERE HIDDEN BY A CURTAIN SHE LEANED ON A WINDOW SILL AND WATCHED THEOUTER WORLD.CECIL DID NOT APPEAR TILL DINNER WAS ON THE TABLE. HE WAS AGOODLOOKING LAD OF SEVENTEEN BRIGHT AND PLEASANT IN MANNER THOUGHSOMEWHAT FOPPISH IN HIS PERSON AND NOT WITHOUT THE CONCEIT COMMON TOYOUTHS OF HIS AGE. STILL ALDYTH FELT THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE HIM WHEN SHEKNEW HIM BETTER. BUT ALL HER IMPRESSIONS THAT EVENING SEEMED VAGUE ANDUNREAL. SHE FELT LIKE ONE IN A DREAM AS SHE SAT LISTENING TO THE TALKTHAT WENT ON AND REPLYING TO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO HER.MRS. STANTON AS SEEMED TO BE HER HABIT NOT ONLY SPOKE FOR HERSELFBUT SAID EVERYTHING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD SAID WHILST HE SITTINGOPPOSITE TO HER SILENT AND MELANCHOLY OCCASIONALLY MURMURED ANASSENT. SHE HAD MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK RESPECTING WOODHAM AND VARIOUSFAMILIES RESIDING IN THE VICINITY TO WHICH MISS LORRAINE WAS ONLY TOOPLEASED TO MAKE FULL REPLIES.GLADYS WHOSE VIVACITY SEEMED INEXHAUSTIBLE CHATTED FAST WITH HERBROTHER AND ALDYTH MR. STANTON AND NELLY WERE THE ONLY SILENT ONES.THE LATTER SEATED OPPOSITE TO ALDYTH MADE GOOD USE OF HER OPPORTUNITYOF OBSERVING THE APPEARANCE OF HER HALFSISTER.IF ALDYTHS GLANCE MET HERS SHE LOOKED AWAY HURRIEDLY BUT HEREYES RETURNED TO THE INSPECTION AND ALDYTH WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THEYTRAVELLED OVER HER AND THAT APPARENTLY NO DETAIL OF HER PERSONESCAPED THEIR NOTICE. BUT AS SOON AS DINNER WAS OVER NELLY BURIEDHERSELF IN A BOOK AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONVERSE WITH ALDYTH.ALDYTH SAID HER MOTHER COMING UP TO HER AND LAYING HER HAND ON HERSHOULDER I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOUR UNCLE AT HIS GREAT AGE KEEPSSO HALE AND WELL. TOMORROW WE MUST HAVE A QUIET TALK TOGETHER ANDYOU SHALL TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM AND YOUR COUSIN GUY.YES I WILL SAID ALDYTH HER HEART THROBBING WITH JOY AT THE THOUGHTOF THAT CONFIDENTIAL TALK. OH MOTHER I AM SO HAPPY TO THINK THAT ICAN TALK TO YOU AT LAST.DARLING SAID HER MOTHER PRESSING HER HAND. BUT DONT CALL MEMOTHER IN THAT SOLEMN WAY ALDYTH. IT MAKES ME FEEL SOI DONT KNOWWHAT. SAY MAMMA AS GLADYS DOES.THE LIGHTLYSPOKEN WORDS JARRED ON ALDYTH IN HER VIVID EMOTION. BUTNOTHING COULD BE MORE TENDER AND CARESSING THAN HER MOTHERS MANNER TOHER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND WHEN ON PARTING FOR THE NIGHT ALDYTHFOUND HERSELF AGAIN FOLDED IN HER MOTHERS ARMS HER HEART WAS TOO FULLOF HAPPINESS TO HAVE ANY DOUBT.YOU ARE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR AUNT WILL BE QUITE COMFORTABLETHEREYOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT ASKED MRS. STANTONWITH AN AIR OF MATERNAL SOLICITUDE. MR. STANTON WAS SO VEXEDWERE YOUNOT ROBERT THAT HE FORGOT TO ORDER ROOMS FOR YOU IN THE HOTEL.MR. STANTON LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED AT HIS WIFES APPEAL TO HIM BUTREPLIED TO HER WORDS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. THEN AT HER SUGGESTION HEFOUND HIS HAT AND COAT AND ESCORTED ALDYTH AND HER AUNT ACROSS THESTREET TO THEIR LODGINGS.CHAPTER XV.ALDYTH WAKES FROM A DREAM.ALDYTH DID NOT HAVE THE PROMISED TALK WITH HER MOTHER ON THE MORROW.SEVERAL DAYS PASSED ALL SO FULL OF OCCUPATION THAT MRS. STANTON HAD NOLEISURE HOUR TO SPARE FOR HER ELDEST DAUGHTER.WHEN WE GET INTO OUR OWN HOUSE WE SHALL HAVE MORE TIME WITH EACHOTHER DARLING HER MOTHER WOULD SAY WITH A SMILE AND CARESS AND THENDRIVE AWAY WITH HER HUSBAND AND GLADYS TO VISIT FRIENDS OR INSPECTHOUSES.ALDYTH AND HER AUNT WENT ABOUT SIGHTSEEING IN LONDON WITH NELLY ANDCECIL. ALDYTH TRIED HARD TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF HER YOUNGER SISTERBUT FOR SOME TIME WITH POOR SUCCESS. NELLYS SHYNESS WAS NOT TO BEOVERCOME. WHEN THEY WERE OUT SHE KEPT AS MUCH WITH HER BROTHER ASPOSSIBLE AND ALDYTH THUS OFTEN FOUND HERSELF HER AUNTS COMPANION.NOTHING DEFINITE HAD BEEN SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BUT THE STANTONSSEEMED TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT ALDYTH WOULD REMAIN WITH HER MOTHERAS LONG AS SHE WAS IN ENGLAND. MISS LORRAINES APPETITE FOR TOWNENTERTAINMENTS WAS NOT EASILY SATED BUT WHEN A WEEK HAD PASSED SHEBEGAN TO TALK OF RETURNING TO WOODHAM. MRS. STANTON HOWEVER BEGGEDHER TO REMAIN WITH ALDYTH TILL EARLY IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHEN THEYWOULD MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN AT BAYSWATER.ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE LAST DAY OF HER STAY IN TOWN MISS LORRAINEDECIDED THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON ONE OR TWO FRIENDS AND RATHERTO ALDYTHS SURPRISE DID NOT INVITE HER NIECE TO ACCOMPANY HER. ALDYTHWENT ACROSS TO THE HOTEL TO FIND OUT WHAT HER SISTERS INTENDED TO DO.SHE FOUND NELLY BY HERSELF HANGING OVER THE FIRE IN THE SITTING ROOMAND LOOKING FAR FROM AMIABLE.WHAT ALL ALONE NELLY SHE SAID. WHERE ARE THE OTHERSOH MAMMA AND GLADYS HAVE GONE SHOPPING. I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKETHEIR SHOPPING THERE IS NO END TO IT. AND PAPA AND CECIL HAVE GONE TOTHE HOSPITAL TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CECIL STUDYING THERE.SO AND YOU ARE LEFT ALL ALONE. WELL I AM IN THE SAME LONELYCONDITION FOR AUNTIE HAS GONE OFF TO PAY VISITS AND NEVER SO MUCH ASASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH HER.OH I AM USED TO THAT SORT OF THING SAID NELLY FORLORNLY. MAMMANEVER CARES TO HAVE ME WITH HER. I AM TOO UGLY AND AWKWARD.OH NELLY HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS OF YOURSELF EXCLAIMED ALDYTH.IT IS TRUE SAID NELLY. MAMMA FEELS THAT I AM NO CREDIT TO HERAND SHE IS ASHAMED FOR ME TO BE SEEN. OH YOU NEED NOT LOOK SHOCKEDALDYTH. YOU DO NOT KNOW MAMMA YET.I HOPE YOU ARE MISTAKEN IN SO JUDGING HER SAID ALDYTH GENTLY. BUTNOW NELLY WHAT SHALL WE DO SINCE WE ARE LEFT TO OURSELVESI DONT CARE SAID NELLY INDIFFERENTLY.WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ACROSS TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY WE SEEM TO HAVENEGLECTED THAT JUST BECAUSE IT IS SO NEAR. THERE ARE SOME OF THE FINESTPICTURES IN THE WORLD TO BE SEEN THERE. BUT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT CARE FORLOOKING AT PICTURES.I CARE VERY MUCH SAID NELLY BRIGHTENING. I REALLY LIKE PICTURESMORE THAN GLADYS ONLY I DO NOT MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT THEM AS SHEDOES.SO THEY WENT TO THE GALLERY AND SPENT A COUPLE OF HOURS THERE VERYPLEASANTLY. ALDYTH FOUND THAT NELLY TOOK A REAL AND INTELLIGENTINTEREST IN THE PICTURES. ALDYTH WHO WAS A DEVOUT DISCIPLE OF RUSKINHAD A PROFOUND ADMIRATION OF TURNER AND SHE SOON KINDLED IN NELLY ALIKE ENTHUSIASM FOR HIS PAINTINGS. TOGETHER THEY STUDIED THE SLIGHTSKETCHES WHICH GIVE SUCH INTERESTING INDICATIONS OF THE GRADUALDEVELOPMENT OF HIS GENIUS.AS THEY TALKED THEM OVER NELLY GREW CONFIDENTIAL AND TOLD HER SISTEROF HER GREAT DESIRE TO STUDY ARTA DESIRE WHICH WOULD NOT BE QUENCHEDBY THE EFFORTS OF ALL HER FAMILY TO THROW COLD WATER UPON IT.I WANT MAMMA TO LET ME STUDY AT SOUTH KENSINGTON SHE SAID BUT SHESAYS IT IS OF NO USE FOR I SHOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING WORTH DOING. SHEIS GOING TO LOOK FOR A SCHOOL FOR ME AS SOON AS SHE CAN FIND TIME. I AMTO GO AS A WEEKLY BOARDER. IS NOT THAT HORRIDPERHAPS YOU WILL LIKE IT BETTER THAN YOU EXPECT SAID ALDYTH. NODOUBT THERE WILL BE A GOOD DRAWING MASTER.AH THAT WOULD BE NICE SAID NELLY. BUT ALL MAMMA WANTS IS TO GET MEOUT OF THE WAY. YOU KNOW MAMMA MEANS TO GET GLADYS MARRIED WHILST WEARE OVER HERE.NELLY SAID ALDYTH.AH YOU ARE SHOCKED AT MY SAYING SO BUT IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE. MAMMAIS DETERMINED THAT GLADYS SHALL MARRY WELL. AS FOR ME I DONT KNOWWHAT MAMMA WILL DO WITH ME. I AM AFRAID NO ONE WILL EVER WANT TO MARRYME AND MAMMA WILL THINK IT SO DISGRACEFUL TO HAVE A DAUGHTER AN OLDMAID.ALDYTH COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE WAY HER SISTER SAID THIS.INDEED NELLY THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN BEING AN OLD MAID AS YOUCALL IT SHE SAID QUICKLY IT IS FAR BETTER TO REMAIN SINGLE THAN TOMAKE AN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE. AND THERE ARE MANY HONOURABLE CAREERS OPEN TOWOMEN. YOU MIGHT BE ALL ARTIST PERHAPS.AH THAT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL SAID NELLY HER EYES KINDLING A GREATDEAL BETTER THAN BEING MARRIED.WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL NELLY DECLARED THAT SHE HAD THOROUGHLYENJOYED THE AFTERNOON AND ALDYTH WAS GLAD TO FEEL THAT IT HAD DRAWNTHEM CLOSER TOGETHER. BUT SHE HERSELF WAS FAR FROM EXPERIENCING PERFECTCONTENT. DAY BY DAY IN SPITE OF HER EFFORTS TO STIFLE IT A FEELING OFDISAPPOINTMENT WAS GROWING STRONGER WITHIN HER.YOU DO NOT KNOW MAMMA YET NELLY HAD SAID. WAS IT SO INDEED HADSHE YET TO LEARN HER MOTHERS TRUE CHARACTER AND WAS IT SO TOTALLYDIFFERENT FROM ALL THAT SHE HAD CONCEIVED IT TO BE THE THOUGHT WASFULL OF PAIN. ALDYTH TRIED TO PUT IT AWAY FROM HERTRIED TO PERSUADEHERSELF THAT SHE WAS ATTACHING TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE WORDS OF ATHOUGHTLESS ILLTEMPERED CHILD BUT WITH ALL HER ENDEAVOURS THE DOUBTWAS NOT TO BE DISMISSED.AND YET AS SHE WATCHED HER BEAUTIFUL MOTHER AND MARKED HER QUEENLYMOVEMENTS HER GRACEFUL KINDLINESS ALDYTH FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVETHAT HER CHARMING APPEARANCE MASKED A SELFISH WORLDLY SPIRIT FOR SHESAW HER MOTHER AT HER BEST.

YOU ARE MISTAKEN SHE SAID COLDLY THERE IS NO ONEELSE BUT I CANNOT SEE THAT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE.WELL OF ALL FOOLISH UNPRACTICAL GIRLS YOU ARE THE WORST I COULDEVER IMAGINE SAID MRS. STANTON INDIGNANTLY. WHY MOST GIRLS WOULDJUMP AT SUCH AN OFFER.BUT ALDYTH HAD RISEN AND WAS HURRYING FROM THE ROOM. SHE RAN UP STAIRSWITH HOT TEARS IN HER EYES AND A CHOKING SENSATION IN HER THROAT. SHEWAS INDIGNANT WITH HER MOTHER FOR UTTERING SUCH WORDS.IT WAS A SORE WOUND TO FIND THAT THE MOTHER WHOM UNKNOWN SHE HAD LOVEDDEVOTEDLY ALL HER LIFE WAS CAPABLE OF GIVING HER SUCH LOW WORLDLYCOUNSEL. IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO HIDE FROM HERSELF THE KEENDISAPPOINTMENT SHE WAS SUFFERING. THE TRUTH WAS NOT TO BE DISGUISED.HER MOTHER BEAUTIFUL CHARMING GRACIOUS AS SHE APPEARED WAS NOT THEMOTHER OF WHOM SHE HAD DREAMED THROUGH LONG YEARS. THE HOPES SHE HADBUILT ON HER HOMECOMING WERE ALL DELUSIVE. THE PERFECT SYMPATHY THEMUTUAL CONFIDENCE AND HELP TO WHICH SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD WERE NOT TOBE. AS SHE RECOGNIZED THIS FACT CERTAIN WORDS OF CHRISTINA ROSSETTISKEPT REPEATING THEMSELVES IN ALDYTHS MIND   THE HOPE I DREAMED OF WAS A DREAM    WAS BUT A DREAM AND NOW I WAKE    EXCEEDING COMFORTLESS AND WORN AND OLD    FOR A DREAMS SAKE.WERE OTHER THINGS DREAMS TOO WAS SHE INDEED FOOLISHLY ROMANTIC ASHER MOTHER HAD SAID WERE HER IDEALS MISTAKEN THE GLORIOUS VISIONS OFTHE POETS WERE THEY ILLUSIVE THE GRAND POSSIBILITIES THAT LIFE HADSEEMED TO HER TO HOLD AS SHE STUDIED THE INSPIRING UTTERANCES OF THEGREAT TEACHERS OF MANKIND WERE THEY TOO PHANTASMAL WAS THERE INDEEDNO POETRY IN LIFE AND WOULD SHE BE WISER IF SHE CONSENTED TO FOLLOWTHE DICTATES OF VULGAR WORLDLY PRUDENCEIN THE HEARTSICKNESS CAUSED BY THE SHOCK OF HER FIRST REALDISAPPOINTMENT ALDYTH QUESTIONED EVERYTHING. WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF LIFEIF IT WERE SO LOW AND SORDID SO BARREN OF ALL THAT IS TRULY NOBLE ANDELEVATING BUT PRESENTLY HEALTHIER FEELINGS RETURNED TO HER.SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN HER ROOM AND WAS SITTING GAZING DULLY BEFOREHER WHEN A RAY OF WINTRY SUNSHINE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWGLEAMED ON A TINY BUNCH OF VIOLETS WHICH NELLY HAD PLACED ON HERDRESSINGTABLE. ALDYTH CAUGHT THEM UP AND THEIR BEAUTY AND SWEETNESSCOMFORTED HER. AFTER ALL THE WORLD WAS NOT THE DREARY PLACE SHE HADBEEN IMAGINING IT.GOD WAS IN THE WORLD GOD WORKING EVER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PURITYAND LOVELINESS AND GOD WAS LOVE. DID NOT THE POET BROWNING SAY THATTHE GRAND LESSON OF LIFE WAS TO LEARN LOVEWHAT LOVE HAD BEEN WHATLOVE MIGHT BEI BELIEVE IN LOVE AND GOD SAID ALDYTH TO HERSELF AND GOD HELPINGME I WILL BE TRUE TO MY IDEAL OF WHAT MY LIFE SHOULD BE. I WILL NOTLOVE MY MOTHER LESS BECAUSE SHE IS NOT JUST WHAT I HAD FANCIED SHEWOULD BE. IS NOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORBEARANCE NECESSARY IN EVERYHUMAN RELATIONSHIP I WILL STRIVE TO BE TO MY MOTHER ALL THAT ADAUGHTER SHOULD BE AND PERHAPS IN TIME SHE WILL COME TO THINK AS I DOABOUT THINGS. I HOPE SHE DID NOT SEE HOW IMPATIENT AND ANGRY I FELTJUST NOW.AND ALDYTH DRIED HER EYES AND SEEING THAT THE SUNSHINE LOOKEDINVITING PUT ON HER HAT AND JACKET AND SET OFF TO TAKE HER USUALREMEDY FOR DEPRESSIONA GOOD WALK.CHAPTER XVI.CONTRASTS.WHEN NELLY HAD BEEN SENT TO SCHOOL ALDYTH FOUND HERSELF MORE ATLEISURE.GLADYS WAS ALWAYS GOODNATURED AND BRIGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERYCHARMING IN HER PRETTY CARELESS WAYS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP LOVINGHER AND YET AFTER SHE HAD LIVED WITH HER FOR WEEKS ALDYTH FELT THATSHE KNEW HER NO BETTER THAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR MEETING. ITSEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A QUIET TALK WITH GLADYS SHE WAS ALWAYSSELFOCCUPIED RESTLESS EAGER ABOUT TRIFLES. APPARENTLY SHE DID NOTKNOW WHAT SERIOUS THOUGHT WAS. SHE HAD INHERITED HER MOTHERS GIFT OFFASCINATION AND LIKE HER KNEW HOW TO USE IT FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTOF HER OWN ENDS.ALDYTH COULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT HER SISTER TREATED HER UNKINDLYYET AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE FOUND HERSELF GENTLY PUSHED ON ONE SIDE THATGLADYS MIGHT TAKE THE LEAD.GLADYS HAD BEEN FIRST IN THE FAMILY FOR TOO MANY YEARS TO BE WILLINGNOW TO RESIGN HER PREMIERSHIP IN FAVOUR OF ALDYTH JUST BECAUSE SHETOO WAS HER MOTHERS DAUGHTER AND NEARLY THREE YEARS OLDER THANHERSELF. BUT SHE DID NOT ASSERT HER SUPREMACY IN ANY DISAGREEABLEMANNER AND MRS. STANTON ENDEAVOURED TO VEIL HER PREFERENCE FOR GLADYS.YOU DO NOT CARE FOR DANCING ALDYTH SO I MUST NOT TAKE YOU TO THISPARTY OR THIS ENTERTAINMENT IS NOT INTELLECTUAL ENOUGH FOR YOUSHE WOULD SAY WHEN INVITATIONS CAME IN. AND ALDYTH NOT WITHOUTHEARTACHE YET IN ALL SINCERITY WOULD REPLY THAT SHE WOULD RATHERREMAIN AT HOME.ALDYTH USED TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE SATURDAY OF EACH WEEK FOR EARLY ONTHAT DAY NELLY WOULD COME HOME FROM SCHOOL.SHE AND HER YOUNG SISTER HAD BECOME THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND FOUND MUCHENJOYMENT IN EACH OTHERS COMPANY. IT WAS GOOD FOR NELLY TO CONFIDE TOSO SYMPATHETIC A LISTENER THE DETAILS OF HER SCHOOL LIFE. HER MOTHERHAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO INTEREST HERSELF IN THEM. HER MAINANXIETY CONCERNING HER YOUNGEST DAUGHTERS EDUCATION WAS THAT SHESHOULD LEARN TO SPEAK FRENCH AND ACQUIRE A GOOD DEPORTMENT.NELLY HAD GOOD ABILITIES BUT SHE WAS NATURALLY INDOLENT. THE TRAININGSHE HAD RECEIVED HAD NOT TAUGHT HER TO LOVE KNOWLEDGE BUT NOW UNDERALDYTHS INFLUENCE SHE BEGAN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN LITERATURE. SHEWAS WORKING WELL AT HER DRAWING AND CHERISHED THE HOPE OF BEING ANARTIST AND WHEN ALDYTH POINTED OUT TO HER THE FACT THAT EVERY KIND OFKNOWLEDGE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO A PAINTER SHE BESTOWED MORE PAINS ONHER GENERAL SCHOOL WORK.ALDYTH COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HER STEPFATHER WAS A MAN OF WEALTH FORMRS. STANTON AND GLADYS SPENT MONEY LAVISHLY AND THE STYLE OF THEIRHOME WAS MOST LUXURIOUS. THERE WERE SO MANY SERVANTS THAT ALDYTH COULDFIND NO DOMESTIC DUTIES TO PERFORM. SHE WAS AT NO LOSS HOW TO EMPLOYHER LEISURE.MUDIES LIBRARY SUPPLIED HER WITH THE BOOKS SHE DESIRED TO READ ANDALL THE VARIED MEANS OF CULTURE THAT LONDON AFFORDS WERE OPEN TO HER.BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN ALDYTHS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HER FOR LEADING ASELFISH AIMLESS LIFE AND SHE LONGED FOR HER POOR PEOPLE AT WOODHAMAND THE MANY OCCUPATIONS OF HER BUSY LIFE THERE. HOWEVER WORK FOROTHERS ALWAYS COMES TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE IT AND ERELONG IT CAME TO ALDYTH.ONE DAY GLADYS HAVING A PLEASANTER ENGAGEMENT IN PROSPECT MRS.STANTON TOOK ALDYTH TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS AT BLACKHEATH. THERE WASA SMALL PARTY INVITED TO MEET THEM AND AMONGST THE NUMBER WERE ACLERGYMAN AND HIS WIFE IN WHOM ALDYTH SOON FELT CONSIDERABLE INTEREST.MRS. WHEATLEY WAS A SMALL FRAILLOOKING WOMAN BUT FULL OF LIFE ANDENERGY. HER FEATURES WERE PLAIN BUT HER COUNTENANCE HAD A CHARM WHICHBEAUTIES MIGHT ENVY FOR IT BETOKENED RARE INTELLECTUAL POWER COMBINEDWITH ALL THAT IS GOOD AND SWEET AND WOMANLY. ALDYTH FELT DRAWN TO HERAT ONCE AND PROBABLY THE ATTRACTION WAS MUTUAL FOR AS SOON AS ANOPPORTUNITY OCCURRED MRS. WHEATLEY MOVED TO A CHAIR BESIDE ALDYTH ANDBEGAN TO TALK WITH HER.HOW IS IT THAT HALF AN HOURS TALK WITH SOME PERSONS SEEMS EQUAL TOMONTHS OF INTERCOURSE WITH OTHERS IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME ALDYTHFELT PERFECTLY AT HOME WITH MRS. WHEATLEY AND COULD TALK TO HER ASIF SHE WERE AN OLD FRIEND. TO HER SURPRISE ALDYTH LEARNED THAT THISDELICATE REFINEDLOOKING LADY LIVED IN ONE OF THE LEAST DESIRABLELOCALITIES OF THE EASTEND OF LONDON HAVING RESOLUTELY DETERMINEDCONTRARY TO THE ADVICE OF PHYSICIANS AND FRIENDS THAT SHE WOULD MAKEHER HOME IN HER HUSBANDS PARISH AND LIVE AMONG THE POOR PEOPLE SHEDESIRED TO HELP AND RAISE.YOU MUST NOT BELIEVE ALL THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT WHITECHAPEL SHE SAIDBRIGHTLY TO ALDYTH. PEOPLE TALK OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GETTING FRESHAIR THERE BUT EVEN IN WHITECHAPEL THERE IS A BREEZE SOMETIMES ANDWHEN IT IS CLOSE AND HEAVY IN THE STREETS THERE IS FRESH AIR AT THETOPS OF THE HOUSES. OUR ROOMS ARE ON THE FOURTH STORY OF THE HOUSE ANDTHERE IS THE FLAT ROOF OF A TENEMENT ON WHICH I CAN TAKE A WALK WHENI CHOOSE AND WHERE I AM TRYING TO CULTIVATE SOME PLANTS. NOR IS THEMORAL ATMOSPHERE SO HOPELESS AS SOME WOULD MAKE OUT. I COULD SHOW YOUBRAVE MEN IN WHITECHAPEL WHOSE PATIENT ENDURANCE OF A HARD AND PAINFULLOT IS ABSOLUTELY HEROIC AND WOMEN WHOSE PURE NOBLE LIVES UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES THE MOST ADVERSE WOULD PUT DUCHESSES TO SHAME. I KNOWTHEY HAVE OFTEN TAUGHT ME LESSONS I NEEDED TO LEARN.ALDYTH WAS MUCH INTERESTED. IT WAS VEXATIOUS THAT JUST THEN THE LADYOF THE HOUSE SHOULD COME TO HER WITH A REQUEST THAT SHE WOULD PLAYSOMETHING BUT SHE COULD NOT REFUSE. SHE WENT AT ONCE TO THE PIANOAND PLAYED A BRIGHT LITTLE GAVOTTE BY GLUCK THEN BEING URGED TO PLAYAGAIN SHE GAVE ONE OF SCHUBERTS EXQUISITE ENTRANCING MELODIES. MRS.STANTON WAS NOT WITHOUT SATISFACTION IN HER DAUGHTERS PERFORMANCE ANDTHE ADMIRATION IT WON. SHE WISHED THAT GLADYS COULD HAVE BEEN PERSUADEDTO GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO HER PRACTISING.HAPPILY NO ONE HAD TAKEN ALDYTHS PLACE SO SHE WAS ABLE TO RETURN TOMRS. WHEATLEYS SIDE.YOU PLAY VERY WELL IT IS A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TO YOU SAID THATLADY SIMPLY. I WISH YOU WOULD COME AND PLAY TO MY WORKING GIRLS SOMEEVENING.YOUR WORKING GIRLS SAID ALDYTH.YES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CLUB FOR GIRLS EMPLOYED IN FACTORIES ANDWORKSHOPS. IT IS OPEN EVERY EVENING FROM SEVEN TILL TEN. WE HAVEVARIOUS AMUSEMENTS FOR THEM AND WE TRY TO TEACH THEM SEWING ANDCOOKING. WE HAVE A GOOD PIANO AND I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO GET SOME ONE TOGIVE US SOME MUSIC. BESIDES IT IS SO EASY FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU TO WINAN INFLUENCE OVER THEM.INDEED I WILL GLADLY DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID ALDYTH I SHOULDREALLY LIKE TO HELP.I AM SURE YOU WOULD SAID MRS. WHEATLEY IT IS A WORK THAT APPEALSTO A GIRLS HEART. THESE GIRLS HAVE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES WHEN QUITEYOUNG. MANY OF THEM HAVE LEFT THEIR PARENTS AND LIVE IN POOR LODGINGSSHARING THEIR ROOM PERHAPS WITH SEVERAL OTHERS AND WHEN THEIRWORK IS DONE THEY HAVE NO PLACE OF RECREATION SAVE THE STREETS ORTHE MUSICHALLS. A WARM WELLLIGHTED ROOM WHERE THEY CAN SPEND THEEVENING PLEASANTLY IS A GREAT ATTRACTION TO THEM. WE HAVE SOME ROUGHINTRACTABLE GIRLS TO DEAL WITH BUT WE HOPE GRADUALLY TO SOFTEN THEM BYKINDNESS AND I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE A GREAT HELP IN DOING SO.I WILL TRY WHAT I CAN DO SAID ALDYTH. I WILL COME NEXT WEEK IFMAMMA WILL LET ME.ALDYTH WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO GO UNATTENDEDTO WHITECHAPEL SO BEFORE NAMING THE MATTER TO HER SHE SPOKE OF IT TOONE OF THE SERVANTS EXPLAINED TO HER THE KIND OF WORK IN WHICH SHEHAD BEEN INVITED TO JOIN AND ASKED WHETHER SHE WOULD BE WILLING TOSHARE IT BY ACCOMPANYING HER ONCE A WEEK TO THE EASTEND. THE SERVANTAN HONEST GOODHEARTED GIRL WAS PROUD AND PLEASED THAT MISS LORRAINESHOULD SEEK HER ASSISTANCE AND GLADLY CONSENTED.MRS. STANTON MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALDYTHS PLAN THOUGH SHE THOUGHTIT AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHIM OF HERS TO WISH TO GO TO SUCH A HORRIBLEPLACE. IT WAS A HAPPY THING FOR ALDYTH THAT HER MOTHER RARELYINTERFERED WITH HER WISHES EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE ADVERSE TO HER OWN.SO ALDYTH WENT TO HER WORK IN WHITECHAPEL AND MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITHTHE FACTORY GIRLS OF THE EASTEND. IT WAS WORK IN WHICH SHE SOON BECAMEDEEPLY INTERESTED AND IT INSPIRED HER WITH MANY NEW SOLEMN THOUGHTSABOUT LIFE.AS MRS. WHEATLEY HAD FORESEEN THE GIRLS TOOK TO HER AT ONCE FORWOMEN OF THE LOWER CLASSES ARE QUICK TO RECOGNIZE A REAL LADY WHENTHEY SEE ONE AND TO FEEL THE CHARM OF HER GENTLENESS AND SIMPLICITY.ALDYTHS PLEASANT LOOK HER SMILE THE SWEET TONES OF HER VOICE HERFRESH PRETTY GOWNS AND THE DAINTY FLOWERLIKE NEATNESS OF HERPERSON COULD NOT HAVE CHARMED ANY MALE ADMIRER MORE THAN THEY CHARMEDTHESE GIRLS. THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT HER THEY APPLAUDED THE BRIGHTWELLCHOSEN MUSIC SHE GAVE THEM AND THEY WATCHED EAGERLY FOR THECHANCE OF A TALK WITH HER.ALDYTH HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THEIR CONFIDENCE. THEY COULD SEETHAT SHE LIKED TO HEAR ALL THEY COULD TELL HER ABOUT THEMSELVES ANDONE BY ONE THEY TOLD HER OF THE TROUBLES AND HARDSHIPS OF THEIR LIVESNOT COMPLAININGLY BUT IN A SIMPLE MATTEROFFACT MANNER THAT WASTOUCHING IN ITS VERY UNCONSCIOUSNESS.ONE EVENING ALDYTH RETURNING TIRED FROM WHITECHAPEL MET GLADYSALIGHTING FROM A CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR OF THEIR HOME. SHE HAD BEENSPENDING THE EVENING IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION AT THE HOUSE OF SOMEFRIENDS. SHE FOLLOWED ALDYTH INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE A LIGHT SUPPERAWAITED HER.I WILL SIT WITH YOU WHILE YOU TAKE YOUR CHOCOLATE GLADYS SAIDTHROWING OFF HER CLOAK AND SINKING GRACEFULLY INTO AN EASYCHAIR BY THEFIRE. THE ANDERSONS ARE SO NICE ALDYTH IVE HAD THE MOST DELIGHTFULTIME. YOU WERE A SILLY NOT TO COME WITH ME INSTEAD OF GOING TO THOSESTUPID GIRLS AT WHITECHAPEL.ALDYTH LOOKED AT HER SISTER FOR A MOMENT ERE SHE REPLIED.GLADYS DRESSED ALL IN WHITE WITH HER PRETTY NECK UNCOVERED AND HERCORONAL OF GOLDEN HAIR GLEAMING IN THE LAMPLIGHT NEVER LOOKED MOREFAIR.BUT ALDYTH HAD A SUDDEN PAINFUL SENSE OF THE CONTRAST PRESENTED TO HERSISTER BY THE GIRLS SHE HAD LEFT AS YOUNG AS GLADYS AND SOME OF THEMAS FAIR BUT WITH WEARY FACES AND THIN BENT FORMS WHOSE CLOTHES WERESHABBY AND TAWDRY AND WHOSE LIVES HAD SO LITTLE OF WHAT WAS BRIGHT ANDPLEASANT IN THEM.OH GLADYS SHE SAID. DONT GRUDGE OUR GIRLS ANY PLEASURE I CAN GIVETHEM BY GOING. IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT THEIR LIVES ARE IF I WERE ONE OFTHEM I THINK IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BAD TO LOOK ON A GIRL LIKE YOU.AND WHY PRAY ASKED GLADYS WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE.BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO ENJOY AND THEY SO LITTLE SAID ALDYTH.MOST OF THEM ARE AS YOUNG IF NOT YOUNGER THAN YOU AND A FEW OFTHEMFORGIVE ME GLADYSARE ALMOST AS PRETTY. I OFTEN LONG TO TRY THEEFFECT OF DRESSING THEM IN FRESH BECOMING FROCKS. BUT THEIR LIVES AREHARD AND ROUGH. MOST OF THEM TOIL FROM EIGHT IN THE MORNING TILL EIGHTAT NIGHT AND SOME OF THEM WHO CALL THEMSELVES SHOP GIRLS WORKTILL EVEN LATER. THERE WAS A GIRL TO WHOM I SPOKE TONIGHT A BRIGHTYOUNG GIRL OF FIFTEEN AND WHEN I OFFERED HER A BOOK SHE TOLD ME SHECOULD NOT READ BECAUSE HER EYES WERE SO BAD OWING TO HER HAVING TO DOHER WORKSTITCHING BABIES BIBSUNDER A STRONG GASLIGHT ALL DAY LONG.ANOTHER GIRL WHO HAS TO GO UP AND DOWN MANY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS DURINGTHE DAY COULD NOT JOIN IN A GAME BECAUSE HER ANKLES WERE SO DREADFULLYSWOLLEN. DOES IT NOT SEEM HARD THAT SOME YOUNG GIRLS SHOULD HAVE TOLIVE SO WHILST OTHERS HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEART CAN WISH AND NOTHINGTO DO BUT ENJOY THEMSELVES I AM SURE WHEN I LOOK ON THOSE GIRLS I AMASHAMED TO THINK WHAT AN EASY SELFINDULGENT LIFE I HAVE ALWAYS LED.THERE WAS A PASSIONATE QUIVER IN ALDYTHS VOICE AS SHE SPOKE WHICHSHOWED THAT TEARS WERE NOT FAR FROM HER EYES. GLADYS WAS NOT UNMOVED BYHER EARNEST WORDS.BUT THEY BELONG TO THE WORKING CLASS SHE SAID. THEY CANNOT EXPECTTO LEAD SUCH LIVES AS OURS.OH THEY KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH SAID ALDYTH. IT IS WONDERFUL TO MEHOW PATIENTLY THEY BEAR THEIR HARD LOT. LADIES HAVE FINE TIMES OF ITIT IS GOOD TO BE BORN A LADY I HEARD A GIRL SAY TONIGHT BUT IT ISRARELY WE HEAR SUCH REMARKS. AND YET HUMAN NATURE IS THE SAME IN EVERYCLASS AND THESE GIRLS HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS AS YOU AND I.ALDYTH SAID GLADYS IN A SCEPTICAL TONE.INDEED THEY HAVE SAID ALDYTH. THEY YEARN FOR HAPPINESS AS WE DOTHEY FEEL THE SAME EAGERNESS FOR EVERY ATTAINABLE PLEASURE THEY LOVETHINGS THAT ARE BRIGHT AND PRETTY. AH YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW EAGERTHEY WERE FOR A FEW FLOWERS I TOOK TODAY. THE BUNCH WAS GONE IN NOTIME AND THE GIRLS WHO COULD NOT GET A FLOWER WERE SADLY DISAPPOINTED.I HAD TO PROMISE THAT I WOULD BRING SOME MORE NEXT WEEK. I SHALL ASKAUNT TO SEND ME SOME FROM WOODHAM.

DO YOU KNOW WHEN I WASWITH THEM TONIGHT I KEPT THINKING OF THOSE WORDS IN THE BIBLEWHOMAKETH THEE TO DIFFER FROM ANOTHER AND WHAT HAST THOU THAT THOU DIDSTNOT RECEIVE I THINK WE ARE APT TO FORGET THAT ALL THE GOOD THINGS WEHAVE RECEIVEDOUR EDUCATION ACCOMPLISHMENTS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONSAREALL TRUSTS GIVEN TO US TO BE USED FOR OTHERS AND NOT SIMPLY FOR OUROWN ENJOYMENT.OH DONT BE SO DREADFULLY SOLEMN EXCLAIMED GLADYS SUDDENLYSPRINGING UP.

BUT GLADYS I DO WISH YOU WOULD COME TO WHITECHAPELWITH ME SOME NIGHT. IT WOULD GIVE THE GIRLS SUCH PLEASURE TO HEAR YOUSING.BUT GLADYS HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR AT THE IDEA.I COULD NOT REALLY ALDYTH.

SHE WAS MOVED BOTH TO THANKFULNESS AND TO SELFREPROACH AS SHETHOUGHT OF HER UNCLES DANGER AND GUYS BRAVE CONDUCT.PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO HARD ON HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF. PERHAPSTHERE IS MORE IN HIM THAN I SUPPOSE. ANYHOW IT WAS A BRAVE DEED AND IAM GLAD OH SO GLAD AND THANKFUL THAT HE HAD STRENGTH AND COURAGE TODO IT.ONE EFFECT OF HILDAS LETTER WAS TO AWAKE IN ALDYTH A LONGING TO RETURNTO WOODHAM. SHE HAD NOW BEEN ABSENT FROM THE LITTLE TOWN FOR SEVERALMONTHS AND IT WAS WITH SOMEWHAT OF HOMESICKNESS THAT SHE RECALLED ALLTHE VARIED INTERESTS OF HER LIFE THERE. IT WAS SPRING WEATHER NOW ANDAMID THE LONDON STREETS AND SQUARES SHE YEARNED FOR THE COUNTRY LANESAND THE WOODS AND FIELDS BRIGHT WITH PRIMROSES AND COWSLIPS.AND TO THINK THAT MR. GLYNNES SISTER WAS NOW AT WOODHAM ALDYTH WOULDHAVE GIVEN MUCH TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE AND TO JOIN IN THE LONG WALKSWHICH SHE WOULD BE TAKING WITH THE BLANDS. BUT SHE SAGELY REFLECTEDTHAT WE CANNOT HAVE EVERYTHING AT ONCE IN THIS LIFE. SHE HADWHAT FORYEARS HAD BEEN HER HEARTS CHIEF DESIRETHE SOCIETY OF HER MOTHER ANDSISTERS AND SHE MUST BE CONTENT TO RESIGN HER OLD LIFE AT WOODHAMWHICH AS SHE NOW SAW PLAINLY HAD BEEN FULL OF QUIET HAPPINESS.SHE WAS FINDING A NICHE IN HER NEW HOME AND LEARNING DAILY THAT EVENIN LONDON THERE WERE MANY WHO NEEDED HER.

CECIL CAME TO HER WITH TALES OF HIS HOSPITAL EXPERIENCESAND FOUND TO HIS SURPRISE THAT ALDYTH KNEW MORE ABOUT SURGERY THAN MOSTGIRLS AND COULD LISTEN WITH INTELLIGENT INTEREST TO THE HORRORS ATTHE VERY MENTION OF WHICH HIS MOTHER AND GLADYS STOPPED THEIR EARS.AND NELLY LOOKED FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THE PLEASANT OUTINGS WHICHALDYTH CONTRIVED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TOGETHER ALMOST EVERY SATURDAYAFTERNOON. EVEN GLADYS INVARIABLY SOUGHT ALDYTH WHENEVER SHE NEEDEDASSISTANCE OF ANY KIND. BUT TO HER MOTHER DESPITE TENDER WORDS ANDCARESSES ALDYTH COULD NEVER FEEL THAT SHE WAS VERY NEAR AND DEAR. THELONG YEARS OF SEPARATION SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT BETWEEN THEM A VOID THATCOULD NOT EASILY BE BRIDGED OVER.CHAPTER XVII.HILDA IS HAPPY.THREE DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE ALDYTH RECEIVED HILDAS LETTER.

I SUPPOSE I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO AS I LIKE WITH MYOWN THEYLL FIND FAULT WITH ME NO DOUBT WHEN IM GONE BUT I MEAN ITFOR THE BEST.HIS VOICE HAD DROPPED AND AS HE RAMBLED ON THUS IT SEEMED TO ALDYTHTHAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHERE HE WAS AND THAT SHE WAS BY HIS SIDE. SHEHAD FANCIED HIM UNCHANGED WHEN FIRST SHE SAW HIM BUT NOW IT SEEMEDTO HER THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIM THOUGH IT WAS ONE NOT EASY TODEFINE.SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS AND HE LOOKED ROUND WITH A STARTLED AIR BUTRECOVERING HIMSELF SLOWLY HE SAID I DONT KNOW WHY I SHOULD TALKABOUT GOING. I AM NOT SO VERY OLD. SEVERAL OF MY ANCESTORS LIVED TOBE NINETY AND WHY SHOULD NOT I I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED TEMPERATELY. WHYSHOULD NOT I SEE NINETY PLEASE GODI TRUST YOU WILL UNCLE ALDYTH SAID GENTLY BUT NOW AT WHAT TIMEDOES YOUR TRAIN LEAVE FOR WOODHAMEH THE TIME HALFPAST SIX TO BE SURE.

WHEN ALDYTH HAD SEEN HER UNCLE INTO A CABFOR LIVERPOOL STREET SHE HURRIED HOMEWARDS AND REACHED THE HOUSEBARELY IN TIME TO CHANGE HER DRESS AND APPEAR AT THE DINNERTABLE ASUSUAL.HER MIND WAS FULL OF HER UNCLE DURING THE EVENING AND SHE FOUND ITDIFFICULT TO AVOID MENTIONING HIM.A FEW DAYS LATER ALDYTH RECEIVED A SECOND LETTER FROM HILDA THECONTENTS OF WHICH GAVE HER BOTH SURPRISE AND PLEASURE.   OH ALDYTH HILDA WROTE YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE THE GOOD NEWS IHAVE TO TELL YOU. I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT MYSELF THOUGH IT MAKES ME SOHAPPYI CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM. BUT I MUST EXPLAIN. ON SATURDAYMOTHER HAD A MOST POLITE NOTE FROM MR. LORRAINE BEGGING HER TO COME ONMONDAY WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS TO SPEND THE DAY AT WYNDHAM. THE CARRIAGESHOULD BE SENT FOR US AT ANY HOUR THAT WOULD SUIT OUR CONVENIENCE. YOUMAY IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED WE WERE FOR MR. LORRAINE HAD BEEN BARELYCIVIL TO US SINCE THE DAY HE CALLED HERE AND BEHAVED SO RUDE AND IDO NOT THINK MOTHER HAD FORGIVEN HIM FOR TELLING HER SHE DID NOT LOOKAFTER HER DAUGHTERS PROPERLY.   HOWEVER I PERSUADED MOTHER IT WAS HER DUTY TO FORGET THAT NOW ANDKITTY WANTED TO SEE THE HORSES AT WYNDHAM AND IAH I NEED NOT TELLYOU HOW I FELT ABOUT IT ANYHOW MOTHER ACCEPTED THE INVITATION ANDABOUT NOON WE STARTED FOR WYNDHAM.   THE DEAR OLD MANYES I CAN CALL HIM DEAR NOWRECEIVED US WITHCHARMING COURTESY. HE HAD ARRANGED THAT GUY SHOULD TAKE ME AND KITTYFOR A RIDE IN THE AFTERNOON WAS IT NOT GOOD OF HIM YOU CAN FANCY HOWDELIGHTED KITTY WAS NOR WAS I LESS SO AND AS FOR GUY I NEVER SAWHIM IN SUCH SPIRITS. KITTY RODE PANSY AND THE LOVELY CREATURE WAS SOTRICKSY. SHE DOES NOT GET EXERCISE ENOUGH NOW YOU ARE AWAY.   BUT NOW FOR THE MOST WONDERFUL ITEM OF MY NEWS. IT WAS EASY TO SEETHAT THE SQUIRE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOUR WITH GUY. WELL WHILST WEWERE RIDING MR. LORRAINE HAD A LONG TALK WITH MOTHER AND TOLD HER HEHAD DECIDED TO LET GUY TAKE HIS OWN WAY WITH REGARD TO HIS MARRIAGEAND IF HE STILL WISHED TO MARRY ME HE WAS FREE TO DO SO.   AND TO MAKE A SHORT STORY OF IT ALDYTH WE ARE NOW ENGAGED AND INA DAY OR TWO ALL WOODHAM WILL KNOW IT. BUT OF COURSE YOU MUST BETHE FIRST FRIEND TO HEAR OF IT I KNOW HOW GLAD YOU WILL BE. YOU CANSYMPATHIZE WITH ME IN MY HAPPINESS AS NO ONE ELSE CAN. OH I AM HAPPY.I CAN SAY WITH JULIET   MY TRUE LOVE IS GROWN TO SUCH EXCESS    I CANNOT SUM UP HALF MY SUM OF WEALTH.   I WONDER WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY WHEN THEY HEAR OF MY ENGAGEMENT IT WILLBE A SURPRISE FOR IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAID THAT YOU WOULD MARRY YOURCOUSIN. BUT TALKING OF GOSSIP WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MISS RUDKINSLATEST PIECE OF NEWS SHE DECLARES THAT YOUR UNCLE WENT TO LONDON BYTHE FIRST TRAIN ON WEDNESDAY MORNING AND THAT HE DROVE ALL THE WAY TOWICKHAM AND TOOK THE TRAIN THERE IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT KNOWTHAT HE WENT DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO ABSURD I SUPPOSE YOU HAVENOT SEEN HIM IN TOWNTHERE WAS MUCH MORE IN THE LETTER WHICH ALDYTH READ SEVERAL TIMES.SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR OF HILDAS HAPPINESS AND INCLINED TO ESTEEMGUY MORE HIGHLY THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE. IT NEVER OCCURRED TOHER THAT SHE HAD ANY CAUSE TO DEPLORE THE ENGAGEMENT AS LIKELY TOBE DETRIMENTAL TO HER OWN PROSPECTS. ALDYTH WAS NOT WONT TO CONCERNHERSELF GREATLY ABOUT HER FUTURE AND SHE HAD NEVER FELT ANXIOUS TOKNOW HER UNCLES INTENTIONS WITH RESPECT TO HIS PROPERTY. A HEALTHYHAPPY GIRLHOOD HAS NO TEMPTATION TO BE GREEDY AFTER WEALTH. IT SEEMEDTO HER A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HER UNCLES HORSE HAD RUN AWAYSINCE GUYS GALLANT CONDUCT HAD SO SOFTENED THE OLD MANS FEELINGS ASTO MAKE HIM FOR ONCE RENOUNCE A CHERISHED WISH.AND SO PEOPLE HAD SAID THAT SHE WOULD MARRY GUY IT WAS NOT SURPRISINGBUT IT VEXED HER TO THINK OF IT. HAD MR. GLYNNE HEARD IT SAID THECOLOUR DEEPENED IN HER CHEEKS AS SHE ASKED HERSELF THE QUESTION. WELLIF SO HE WOULD NOW KNOW THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE. ALDYTH WAS GLAD TOTHINK THIS SHE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF HIS SUPPOSING THAT SHE WOULDBE WILLING TO MARRY GUY.HILDAS LETTER HAD PUT ALDYTH INTO EXCELLENT SPIRITS. BUT WHEN SHEHASTENED TO SHARE THE NEWS WITH HER MOTHER AND SISTER THE BRIGHTNESSOF HER MOOD WAS CHECKED. MRS. STANTON HEARD IT WITH FEELINGS THAT WEREBEYOND CONTROL.YOU CAN PRETEND TO BE PLEASED AT THIS ALDYTH SHE ASKED IN A TRAGICTONE.THERE IS NO PRETENCE ABOUT IT MAMMA. I AM UNFEIGNEDLY GLAD THAT HILDAIS TO MARRY GUY. I USED TO DOUBT IF HE WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER BUT ITHINK BETTER OF HIM NOW.YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO TALK SO CRIED HER MOTHER IN TONES SHARPAND HIGH. I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH YOU. TO THINK THAT YOU MIGHT HAVEBEEN THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM YOU SHOULD BEWAIL YOUR FOLLY INSTEAD OFREJOICING. ONE WOULD THINK YOU HAD NO SENSE.ALDYTH STOOD SILENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A STRONG EFFORT THAT SHEKEPT HERSELF FROM UTTERING HOT INDIGNANT WORDS.NOW YOU HAVE CROSSED HIS WISH I DARE SAY YOUR UNCLE WILL NOT LEAVEYOU A PENNY CONTINUED MRS. STANTON. YOU MIGHT FOR THE SAKE OF USALL HAVE PLAYED YOUR CARDS BETTER THAN THAT. I HOPE YOU WILL NOTINFECT GLADYS WITH YOUR STUPIDLY ROMANTIC NOTIONS.HERE THE FLOW OF MRS. STANTONS ELOQUENCE CEASED ABRUPTLY FOR ALDYTHTURNED WITHOUT A WORD AND QUITTED THE ROOM.YOU NEED NOT HAVE DRAGGED MY NAME INTO THE DISCUSSION MAMMA SAIDGLADYS WITH SCORN IN HER TONES. YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT I BELONG TOANOTHER ORDER OF BEING AND COULD NEVER ACT LIKE ALDYTH.I HOPE NOT INDEED SAID MRS. STANTON DEVOUTLY. I TRUST YOU HAVEMORE WISDOM.I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID GLADYS THOUGH THE BIBLE DOES SAY THATTHE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD ARE IN THEIR GENERATION WISER THAN THECHILDREN OF LIGHT. YOU AND I BELONG THIS WORLD MAMMA. I RATHER FANCYALDYTH MUST BE ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT.WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SPEAKING IN THAT ABSURD WAY IT IS NOT LIKE YOUGLADYS.ALDYTH HAD HURRIED FROM HER MOTHERS PRESENCE THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BEOVERMASTERED BY AN IMPULSE TO RELIEVE HER IRRITATED FEELING BY QUICKPASSIONATE WORDS. SHE HAD A GREAT DREADBORN OF THE SACRED IDEA OFMOTHERHOOD SHE HAD EVER CHERISHEDOF BEING DRIVEN TO UTTER BITTERUNBECOMING WORDS TO HER MOTHER. IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING FOR GLADYSTO ADDRESS HER MOTHER DISRESPECTFULLY. ANGRY WORDS SOMETIMES PASSEDBETWEEN THEM THOUGH THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS AS A RULE. BUT IF ALDYTHEVER HAD A SCENE WITH HER MOTHER SHE KNEW THAT THE THOUGHT OF IT WOULDLEAVE AN INDELIBLE STAIN UPON HER CONSCIOUSNESS AND TURN TO BITTERESTIRONY THE HOPES OF PAST YEARS.MRS. STANTON DID NOT AGAIN REFER TO GUYS ENGAGEMENT BUT SHE TREATEDALDYTH WITH MARKED COLDNESS DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BUT AS IFTO ATONE FOR HER MOTHERS UNKINDNESS GLADYS MANNER TOWARDS HERSISTER WAS MORE AFFECTIONATE THAN USUAL. IT WAS SHE WHO INSISTED THATALDYTH SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO THE HORTICULTURAL GARDENS ON SATURDAYAFTERNOON. ALDYTH CONSENTED WITH SOME RELUCTANCE FOR SHE WOULD HAVEPREFERRED TO SPEND THE TIME WITH NELLY AS USUAL. BUT SHE COULD HARDLYREGRET THAT SHE HAD COME WHEN THEY REACHED THE GARDENS WHICH WERELOOKING THEIR LOVELIEST IN THE FIRST FRESH BEAUTY OF THE SPRING.MR. AND MRS. STANTON SEATED THEMSELVES UNDER THE TREES TO LISTEN TO THEBAND BUT THE GIRLS PREFERRED TO MOVE ABOUT ADMIRING THE FLOWERS ANDOBSERVING THE WELLDRESSED CROWD. SOME OF THE LADIES WERE SO FAIR ANDSO CHARMINGLY DRESSED THAT THEY SEEMED TO RIVAL THE FLOWERS IN BEAUTY.ALDYTH DID NOT WONDER THAT MANY EYES WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SISTERSHE SAW NO ONE PRETTIER THAN GLADYS IN HER GOWN OF PALEST BLUE ANDLARGE WHITE HAT. BUT ATTRACTIVE AS WAS THE APPEARANCE OF GLADYS ALDYTHDID NOT SUFFER TOTAL ECLIPSE AS SHE WALKED BY HER SIDE. SEVERAL PERSONSINQUIRED THE NAME OF THE TALL GIRL WHO WAS MISS STANTONS COMPANIONAND DECIDED THAT THOUGH SHE MIGHT NOT BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL THERE WASSOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ABOUT HER.ALDYTH WENT SO LITTLE INTO SOCIETY THAT SHE DID NOT EXPECT TO MEET ANYONE SHE KNEW. GLADYS STOPPED NOW AND THEN TO CHAT WITH ACQUAINTANCESAND WAS CAREFUL TO INTRODUCE HER SISTER BUT ALDYTH FELT HERSELF AMIDSTSTRANGERS TILL SUDDENLY AS SHE STOOD ON THE OUTSKIRT OF A LITTLEGROUP A GENTLEMAN PAUSED BEFORE HER BOWING AND SAYING IN TONES OFPLEASURABLE SURPRISEMISS LORRAINE THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE. SOMEHOW ONE SEEMS TOFORGET THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR WOODHAM PEOPLE TO COME TO LONDON.IT WAS CAPTAIN WALKER.ALDYTH GREETED HIM WITH PLEASURE AND THEY ENTERED AT ONCE INTOAN ENJOYABLE CHAT OVER WOODHAM AFFAIRS. HE HAD NOT HEARD OF GUYSENGAGEMENT AND THE NEWS SEEMED GREATLY TO PLEASE HIM. ALDYTH WASAMUSED AT THE WARMTH WITH WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT.PRESENTLY ALDYTH INTRODUCED HIM TO GLADYS AND A LITTLE LATER TO HERMOTHER WHO DECIDING AT ONCE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD A DISTINGUISHEDAPPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM MOST GRACIOUSLY. CAPTAIN WALKER REMAINED WITHTHEM AS LONG AS THEY STAYED IN THE GARDENS. AS HE SAW THEM INTO THEIRCARRIAGE MRS. STANTON INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS AT HOME ONSUNDAY EVENINGS AND BEGGED THAT HE WOULD GIVE THEM THE PLEASURE OF HISCOMPANY ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING.ALDYTH HAD ALWAYS LIKED CAPTAIN WALKER AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HERTO SEE AN OLD FRIEND WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT WOODHAM AND HER LIFE THERE.SHE WAS SORRY THAT HER MOTHER HAD INVITED HIM FOR SUNDAY EVENING FOREVER SINCE HER COMING TO LONDON SHE HAD MADE IT A RULE NOT TO JOIN THEPARTY GATHERED IN THE DRAWING ROOM ON THAT EVENING. THE LORDS DAY WASSACRED AND PRECIOUS TO ALDYTH. SHE LIKED TO FEEL THAT IT WAS DIFFERENTFROM EVERY OTHER DAY. IT WAS NO HARDSHIP BUT A PLEASURE TO HER WHENAT WOODHAM TO ATTEND BOTH SERVICES AT THE CHURCH AND TO SPEND THEAFTERNOON WITH HER CLASS IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL.BUT SUNDAY OBSERVANCES WERE DEEMED IRKSOME IN HER MOTHERS HOME. INHER AUSTRALIAN LIFE MRS. STANTON HAD FORSAKEN THE RELIGIOUS HABITS OFEARLIER DAYS. SHE HAD LEARNED TO LAUGH AT THE OLDFASHIONED SABBATH OFHER CHILDHOOD AND SHE CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY RECOGNIZEDTHE SACRED CHARACTER OF THE DAY IF SHE ATTENDED A SHORT SERVICE IN THEFORENOON. THAT OVER THE REST OF THE DAY MIGHT BE GIVEN TO PLEASURE ANDSELFINDULGENCE.ALDYTH COULD SEE LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUNDAYS AND OTHER DAYS INHER NEW HOME BUT SHE COULD NOT BEAR SO TO WASTE THE DAY SHE FOUND SOHELPFUL IF RIGHTLY SPENT. SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO AVOW HER CONVICTIONSON THE SUBJECT AND TO MAKE A POINT OF ATTENDING AN EVENING SERVICE.MRS. STANTON LAUGHED AT HER PURITANICAL NOTIONS BUT LEFT HER FREE TODO AS SHE LIKED. NOR DID SHE RAISE ANY OBJECTION WHEN NELLY BEGAN TOACCOMPANY HER SISTER. MRS. STANTON FOUND HER YOUNGEST DAUGHTER NOT EASYTO MANAGE SHE WAS APT TO GET CROSS AND SULKY IF ANYTHING PUT HER OUTSO THAT HER ABSENCE WHEN VISITORS WERE EXPECTED WAS RATHER A RELIEFTHAN OTHERWISE.ALDYTH THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT SHE WOULD BE URGED TO REMAIN AT HOME ONTHE FOLLOWING EVENING BUT RATHER TO HER SURPRISE NO NOTICE WAS TAKENOF THE FACT THAT CAPTAIN WALKER WAS HER FRIEND. SHE WENT TO CHURCH ASUSUAL AND AFTERWARDS REMAINED QUIETLY IN HER ROOM TILL THE VISITORSHAD DEPARTED. COMING DOWN STAIRS THEN SHE FOUND HER MOTHER AND GLADYSIN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR.IT WAS A PITY YOU TOOK YOURSELF OFF GLADYS SAID. WE HAVE HAD ADELIGHTFUL EVENING. CAPTAIN WALKER ASKED WHERE YOU WERE.YOU NEVER TOLD ME ALDYTH THAT HE WAS NEPHEW TO SIR RICHARDCOURTENAY SAID MRS. STANTON IN A TONE OF REPROOF FOR AUGHT I KNEWHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST ANYBODY.I HAD FORGOTTEN IT MAMMA SAID ALDYTH. NOW YOU MENTION IT IREMEMBER HEARING GUY SAY THAT HE WAS RELATED TO SIR RICHARD COURTENAY.YOU SHOULD REMEMBER SUCH THINGS SAID MRS. STANTON FROWNING. WHYMRS. GIBSON TELLS ME IT IS NOT AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THE BARONETCY MAYFALL TO HIM.WELL I NEVER HEARD THAT SAID ALDYTH.WHATEVER HE MAY BE IN THE FUTURE HE IS VERY NICE NOW SAID GLADYS.HE UNDERSTANDS MUSIC PERFECTLY. HE SAYS MY VOICE REMINDS HIM OFANTOINETTE STERLING. HE IS GOING TO BRING HIS VIOLIN WITH HIM WHEN NEXTHE COMES.IT WAS NOT LONG ERE THE CAPTAIN REPEATED HIS VISIT. ALDYTH WAS ATHOME AND MUCH TO HIS SATISFACTION SHE ACCOMPANIED HIS VIOLIN ONTHE PIANOFORTE. AS THEY PLAYED ONE FAVOURITE PIECE AFTER ANOTHERIT SEEMED LIKE A RETURN OF THE OLD DAYS AT WYNDHAM. BUT ALDYTH WASCAREFUL THAT GLADYS SHOULD NOT FEEL HERSELF EXCLUDED FROM THE EVENINGSENTERTAINMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT HER VOICE WENT CHARMINGLY WITH THEVIOLIN AND SHE WAS PERSUADED TO SING SEVERAL TIMES. BUT HOWEVER THECAPTAIN MIGHT APPLAUD A QUICK EAR WOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT GLADYSMUSICAL PERFORMANCE LACKED THE ACCURACY AND FINISH OF ALDYTHS.IT WAS A DIFFERENCE AKIN TO THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE CHARACTERS OFTHE TWO GIRLS. ALDYTH HAD STUDIED MUSIC WITH THE THOROUGHNESS WHICHMARKED HER PURSUIT OF EVERY KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IN HER DESIRE AFTERPERFECTION SHE HAD SPARED HERSELF NO PAINS SHRUNK FROM NO SACRIFICEOF TIME AND PLEASURE WITH THE RESULT THAT SHE HAD ATTAINED A BEAUTIFULTOUCH AND PLAYED WITH RARE POWER AND EXPRESSION. GLADYS HAD STUDIED INA SUPERFICIAL HALFHEARTED FASHION WISHFUL ONLY TO ACQUIRE A CERTAINEFFECTIVENESS. IT FOLLOWED IN CONSEQUENCE THAT CAPTAIN WALKER ALTHOUGHHE HAD LIKENED HER VOICE TO THAT OF ANTOINETTE STERLING WAS PERFECTLYAWARE THAT HER SINGING WAS VERY FAULTY AND HER CHOICE OF SONGS POOR.CAPTAIN WALKER SAID ALDYTH LEANING BACK FROM THE PIANO TO ADDRESSHIM WHEN THEY HAD JUST FINISHED A BRILLIANT FANTASIA IN WHICH HE HADPLAYED HIS PART WITH GREAT SKILL I WISH YOU WOULD COME TO WHITECHAPELSOME EVENING AND PLAY TO MY FACTORY GIRLS.TO WHITECHAPEL HE REPEATED WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE.MY DEAR ALDYTH EXCLAIMED MRS. STANTON IN A TONE OF REBUKE. HOW CANYOU ASK CAPTAIN WALKER TO GO TO THAT DREADFUL PLACE IF YOU CHOOSE TOGO THERE YOURSELF YOU CANNOT EXPECT THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL LIKE TO DOSO.NO PLACE CAN BE TOO DREADFUL FOR ME TO WHICH MISS LORRAINE GOES SAIDTHE CAPTAIN. I SHALL BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HERTHERE.OH THANK YOU SAID ALDYTH. IT WOULD BE SO KIND OF YOU TO COME ANDPLAY TO THE GIRLS SOME EVENING. THEY ARE VERY FOND OF MUSIC.I CALL IT A POOR COMPLIMENT TO CAPTAIN WALKER TO ASK HIM TO PLAY TOA LOT OF LOW FACTORY GIRLS SAID GLADYS. WHAT CAN THEY KNOW OF GOODMUSICBUT CAPTAIN WALKER DID NOT APPEAR TO REGARD THE REQUEST ASUNCOMPLIMENTARY. HE LOOKED PLEASED AND LISTENED WITH INTEREST ASALDYTH TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THE WORK AT WHITECHAPEL. HE READILY PROMISEDTO HELP AND A DAY WAS FIXED FOR HIS VISIT.BUT THERE WAS A CLOUD ON MRS. STANTONS FACE AS SHE HEARD THEARRANGEMENT MADE AND ALDYTH SOON LEARNED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN ANNOYANCETO HER MOTHER AND SISTER.CHAPTER XVIII.A SUMMONS TO WYNDHAM.CAPTAIN WALKER CAME TO HELP TO ENTERTAIN THE FACTORY GIRLSNOTONCE ONLY BUT SEVERAL TIMES. HE ENDURED WITH A GOOD GRACE HEARINGHIMSELF DESCRIBED AS THE MAN WITH THE FIDDLE AND PLAYED HISBEST TO A CLAMOROUS AUDIENCE WHO TALKED AND SQUABBLED THROUGH HISFINEST PASSAGES BUT SHOWED THEIR APPRECIATION OF HIS PERFORMANCE BYAPPLAUDING VOCIFEROUSLY AT THE CLOSE.ALDYTH REFLECTED THAT SHE HAD NEVER GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR SO MUCH GOODNATURE AS HE NOW MANIFESTED. FOND AS HE WAS OF HIGHCLASS MUSIC HECOULD EVEN CONDESCEND TO PLAY A FESTIVE JIG FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THEGIRLS. ALDYTH FELT MUCH GRATITUDE FOR HIS WILLING ASSISTANCE AND SHEWAS FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HOW SWEET TO HIM WERE HER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OFTHE SAME. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE WAS THE ATTRACTION WHICHDREW HIM SO OFTEN TO WHITECHAPEL. SHE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR FEELING AGENUINE INTEREST IN THE WORK FOR SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS FORHER SAKE MERELY THAT HE TOOK SO MUCH TROUBLE.YET IN TRUTH THE MOTIVE WHICH ACTUATED CAPTAIN WALKER WAS ONE WHICH HASDRAWN MANY ANOTHER MAN INTO A TEMPORARY PERFORMANCE OF GOOD WORKS. HEHAD BEEN CHARMED WITH ALDYTH WHENEVER HE MET HER AT WOODHAM OR WYNDHAMBUT HE HAD SHARED THE COMMON BELIEF THAT SHE WAS DESTINED TO MARRYHER COUSIN AND HAD STEELED HIS HEART TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION SHEHAD FOR HIM. BUT NOW HE KNEW SHE WAS FREE THERE WAS NO RESISTING THEFASCINATION OF HER SOCIETY. HE COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPLAINED WHEREIN THESTRENGTH OF THAT FASCINATION LAY.HE HAD BEEN MUCH IN SOCIETY HE HAD SEEN MANY WOMEN WHO WERE PRETTIERTHAN ALDYTH. HE ADMIRED GLADYS STANTON IT AMUSED HIM TO TALK ANDLAUGH WITH HER BUT SHE NEVER EXCITED WITHIN HIM A PAINFUL SENSE OFHIS OWN INFERIORITY NOR CAUSED HIM TO APPROACH HER WITH TIMID TENDERREVERENCE. BUT ALDYTH WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER GIRL HE HAD EVERKNOWN. SHE HAD ALL THE FRESHNESS AND BRIGHTNESS OF GIRLHOOD AND YETSHE WAS A WOMAN IN HER EXQUISITE SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS HER STRONGSELFRELIANCE HER UNSWERVING PURSUIT OF ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND TRUE.HE HAD A NEW REVELATION OF THE GENTLENESS AND PURITY AND KINDNESS OFHER NATURE WHEN HE SAW HER SURROUNDED BY THE ROUGH COARSE GIRLS WHOGATHERED ABOUT HER AT WHITECHAPEL. ROUGH AS THEY WERE THEY GREW GENTLEIN HER PRESENCE. A WORD A GLANCE EVEN FROM HER WAS OFTEN ENOUGHTO CHECK A QUARREL. NEVER HAD HE FELT MORE CONVINCED OF THE WOMANLYSWEETNESS OF ALDYTHS CHARACTER YET AT THE SAME TIME THERE SWEPTOVER HIM A FEELING THAT HIS LOVE WAS HOPELESS.BUT THE FEELING DID NOT LASTHOW SHOULD IT CAPTAIN WALKERS PASTEXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED HIM TO EXPECT DISAPPOINTMENT SO HE MADETHE MOST OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES SEEING ALDYTH AND THEY WERE MANYFOR MRS. STANTON LAVISHED INVITATIONS ON THE DISTINGUISHEDLOOKINGCAPTAIN AND SEEMED TO THINK NO PARTY OF PLEASURE COMPLETE WITHOUTHIM. BUT HER EFFORTS WERE NOT CROWNED WITH THE SUCCESS SHE DESIRED.AS THE HOT SULTRY DAYS OF JULY SET IN AND EVERY ONE WAS PLANNING ATOUR OR TALKING OF THE SEASIDE MRS. STANTON BEGAN TO FEEL SERIOUSLYDISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF HER ENDEAVOURS.IN VAIN SHE HAD THROWN GLADYS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INTO THE COMPANY OFCAPTAIN WALKER. NOTHING SEEMED LIKELY TO COME OF IT. MRS. STANTON BEGANTO SUSPECT THAT IT WAS ALDYTHS FAULT. IF ONLY SHE HAD NOT THAT CRAZEFOR FACTORY GIRLS IT WAS TOO BAD OF HER TO DRAG THE CAPTAIN TO THATHORRID WHITECHAPEL ONCE EVERY WEEK.ONE NIGHT AS ALDYTH WAS BRUSHING HER HAIR PREPARATORY TO GOING TO BEDHER MOTHER WHO WITH GLADYS HAD BEEN SPENDING THE EVENING OUT CAMEINTO HER ROOM LOOKING SADLY PERTURBED.AH YOU ARE NOT IN BED SHE SAID AS ALL RESPLENDENT IN SATIN ANDLACE SHE SANK INTO A CHAIR. I WANT TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT OURPLANS IF YOU ARE NOT TOO TIRED.I AM NOT VERY TIRED SAID ALDYTH SITTING DOWN AND SHAKING BACK HERHAIR.HAVE YOU BEEN TO WHITECHAPEL THIS EVENING ASKED MRS. STANTONABRUPTLY.YES MAMMA SAID ALDYTH.AND CAPTAIN WALKER WITH YOUSOMETHING IN HER MOTHERS TONES BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO ALDYTHS FACE.HE WAS THERE SHE REPLIED SLOWLY AND HE KINDLY SAW ME HOME.WHY DID HE NOT COME IN ASKED MRS. STANTON.REALLY I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING HIM SAID ALDYTH.AN EXPRESSION OF IMPATIENCE ESCAPED HER MOTHERS LIPS.I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU ALDYTH. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVEWISHED TO HELP AND NOT HINDER YOUR SISTERS HAPPINESS. HAVE YOU NOTNOTICED HOW OFTEN CAPTAIN WALKER COMES HERE AND OF COURSE IT IS TO SEEGLADYS. YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED IT.HE COMES HERE A GREAT DEAL CERTAINLY SAID ALDYTH WITH SOMEEMBARRASSMENT.A FEW DAYS EARLIER SHE COULD HAVE ACCEPTED HER MOTHERS EXPLANATION OFTHE MOTIVE OF THE CAPTAINS FREQUENT VISITS BUT SINCE THEN ONE LITTLETHING AND ANOTHER HAD OCCURRED TO PUT HER ON HER GUARD AND TONIGHT HEHAD LET FALL A WORD WHICH HAD FORCED HER TO RECEIVE A WHOLLY UNWELCOMEIDEA.MRS. STANTON WAS QUICK TO SEE HER EMBARRASSMENT.

THE OLD HIGH STREET HAD THE SAME FAMILIAR ASPECT. THEREWAS MRS. BLAND IN THE BOWWINDOW SMILING AND NODDING. MISS RUDKINSHIGH CAP AND SAUSAGELIKE CURLS APPEARED ABOVE THE WIRE BLIND ON THEOPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD.AND NOW THEY HAD TURNED FROM THE TOWN AND WERE ON THE LONG STRAIGHTROAD TO WYNDHAM.

NOW HES TALKING ABOUT THE FARMDONT YOU HEARAT THAT MOMENT THE PROLONGED HOWL OF A DOG ROSE FROM BENEATH THEWINDOWS STARTLING AND AFFRIGHTING THE WORTHY OLD SOUL.YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS SHE WHISPERED. ITS A SURE SIGN. NOT BUTWHAT I KNEW BEFORE. THERE WAS A ROBIN THIS MORNING SINGING CLOSE TO THEFRONT DOOR AND I KNEW THAT BODED ILL. AH ME THE POOR OLD MASTER BUTWE MUST ALL GO WHEN OUR TIME COMES.HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED WEARILY BY AND BROUGHT NO CHANGE BUT INCREASEDWEAKNESS AND RESTLESSNESS AND MORE IMPERFECT ARTICULATION. LIFE WASSLOWLY EBBING. THE DOCTOR PAID HIS LAST VISIT AND WENT AWAY WITH NOEXPECTATION OF SEEING HIS PATIENT AGAIN IN LIFE.ALL NIGHT THE LABOURED BREATHING THE SAD STRUGGLE SO PITIFUL TOWITNESS WENT ON. GUY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SCENE WENT AWAY ERE THE ENDCAME BUT ALDYTH WAS NOT TO BE PERSUADED TO QUIT HER PLACE BESIDE HERUNCLE. ALL NIGHT SHE AND HER AUNT WATCHED HIM AND HER HAND HELD THECOLD HEAVY HAND OF THE DYING MAN TILL LIFE HAD FLED.THEN AT LAST SHE BROKE DOWN AND WEPT FROM MINGLED SENSATIONS OF RELIEFAND PAIN. MISS LORRAINE HAD STOOD BY TOO MANY DEATHBEDS TO BE THRILLEDAND UNNERVED AS ALDYTH WAS. SHE SOOTHED THE GIRL AND PUT HER TENDERLYTO BED.ALDYTH OPPRESSED BY A SENSE OF THE GLOOM AND MYSTERY OF DEATHPRESENTLY SOBBED HERSELF TO SLEEP WITHOUT GIVING A THOUGHT TO ANYCONSEQUENCES HER UNCLES DEATH MIGHT HAVE FOR HER. THE HOPES AND FEARSTHAT WERE ALTERNATING IN GUYS MIND AND CAUSING HIM MUCH INWARDAGITATION LAY QUITE OUTSIDE HER CONSCIOUSNESS.CHAPTER XIX.THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM.YOU DO NOT SURELY MEAN THAT NOTHING IS LEFT TO GUY SAID MISSLORRAINE IN A TROUBLED TONE.SOME HOURS HAD PASSED SINCE THE SQUIRE BREATHED HIS LAST AND SHE WASWITH MR. RALPH GREENWOOD IN THE OLDFASHIONED LIBRARY. THE BLINDS WEREDOWN AND EVEN THE OUTSIDE VENETIANS CLOSED SHUTTING OUT THE JULYSUNSHINE AND MAKING TWILIGHT IN THE ROOM.THE LAWYER HIS PINCENEZ ON HIS NOSE SAT BEFORE THE SQUIRES OLDBUREAU TURNING OVER SOME PAPERS IN A QUICK BUSINESSLIKE MANNER.BY NO MEANS HE SAID BRISKLY. NO NO IT IS NOT SO BAD AS THAT.GUY HAS FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE FARM AT WOOD CORNER. NOT A BADPROVISION FOR A YOUNG MAN BUT A POOR EQUIVALENT FOR THE HEIRSHIP.WHEN WAS THIS WILL MADE ASKED MISS LORRAINE.AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. GUY HAD HAD A DISAGREEMENT WITH HISUNCLE. IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE AS I TOLD HIM AT THE TIME. I DID MY BESTTO SOFTEN MR. LORRAINES FEELINGS. I ALL BUT REFUSED TO MAKE THE WILLBUT IF I HAD DONE SO HE WOULD HAVE SENT FOR SOME ONE ELSE. WHAT A PITYIT IS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO UNPRACTICAL WHY COULD NOT THOSE TWO HAVEMARRIED NOW AS EVERY ONE EXPECTED OF THEMBUT UNCLE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT OVER THAT ANNOYANCE SAID MISSLORRAINE. HE RECEIVED HILDA BLAND KINDLY AND GAVE HIS CONSENT TO THEENGAGEMENT. I THOUGHT GUY WAS QUITE REINSTATED IN HIS FAVOUR.IT SEEMED SO SAID MR. GREENWOOD. I AM SURE I QUITE HOPED TO HAVETHE PLEASURE OF SETTING THIS ALL RIGHT SOME DAY. I TOLD THE SQUIRE SOWHEN HE SIGNED THE WILL BUT YOU KNOW THE KIND OF MAN HE WASA WEE BITOBSTINATE DONT YOU THINK NOTHING HARDER FOR HIM THAN TO RETRACT. ITSEEMS GUY WAS ABLE TO PERSUADE HIMSELF FROM SOMETHING HIS UNCLE LETFALL THAT THE MATTER HAD BEEN SET RIGHT BUT I KNOW NOTHING OF IT. ISUPPOSE HE DELAYED SENDING FOR ME. THERE IS NOTHING MORE COMMON THANFOR MEN TO PUT OFF BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THEIR WILLS. WE LAWYERS ARECONSTANTLY MEETING WITH SUCH INSTANCES.THEN YOU THINK HE INTENDED TO MAKE ANOTHER WILL SUGGESTED MISSLORRAINE.THE LAWYER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS. HE NEVER CONFIDED HIS INTENTION TOME HE SAID BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AFTER THE BRAVE WAY IN WHICHGUY SAVED HIS LIFEAND HE WAS EVIDENTLY TOUCHED BY ITHE SHOULD HAVECHERISHED SOME SUCH INTENTION. HOWEVER HE DID NOT DO IT SO WE MUSTMAKE THE BEST OF THINGS AS THEY ARE. I AM AFRAID IT WILL BE A SOREDISAPPOINTMENT TO GUY.HE WILL FEEL IT NO DOUBT SAID MISS LORRAINE AND FOR ONE I AMSORRY THAT THINGS WERE NOT EQUALLY DIVIDED.

IT WILLHARDLY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS.THATS AS IT MAY BE SAID MR. GREENWOOD. I DONT MYSELF THINK ITWELL TO MAKE GIRLS TOO WEALTHY THERE IS DANGER OF THEIR FORTUNESFALLING INTO UNWORTHY HANDS. BUT MR. LORRAINE WAS CAREFUL TO TAKECERTAIN PRECAUTIONS. THE MAN WHO MARRIES MISS ALDYTH WILL FIND THAT HEHAS NO CONTROL OVER HIS WIFES FORTUNE AND WILL TOUCH NONE OF IT AFTERHER DEATH SUPPOSING HE SHOULD SURVIVE HER UNLESS HE CONSENT TO TAKETHE NAME OF LORRAINE.AH SAID MISS LORRAINE EXPRESSIVELY. THAT WAS LIKE UNCLE TO TRYTO ORDER THINGS AS HE WOULD EVEN AFTER HIS DEATH. WELL ALDYTH IS NOTLIKELY TO BE MARRIED AT PRESENTPERHAPS SHE NEVER WILL BE.AND MEANWHILE SAID THE LAWYER SHE IS THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAMNOTAN UNENVIABLE POSITION.ILLUSTRATIONI WONDER WHAT SHE WILL SAY WHEN I TELL HER SAID MISS LORRAINEMOVING OFF IN SEARCH OF ALDYTH.AND WHAT WILL GUY SAY ASKED THE LAWYER LOOKING TROUBLED.

HILDA IS CHARMING. I WOULDNOT HAVE HER AN INCH TALLER. I AM SO GLAD UNCLE CHANGED HIS OPINION OFHER.YES SHE IS NOT A BAD LITTLE PARTY SAID GUY COMPLACENTLY. SHESUITS ME DOWN TO THE GROUND.ALDYTH WAS AMUSED TO SEE THAT GUY HAD APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN HISEPISODICAL WOOING OF HERSELF.GUY SAID MISS LORRAINE MR. GREENWOOD IS IN THE LIBRARY AND HEWOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU.THE COLOUR FLEW INTO GUYS FACE. HE ROSE AND WENT AWAY AT ONCE WITHOUTA WORD.THE FOREWOMAN FROM SPENCERS WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY ABOUT OURMOURNING SAID MISS LORRAINE GLANCING AT THE CLOCK.

MUST I TAKE WYNDHAM I AMSURE IF I HAD HAD THE LEAST IDEA UNCLE MEANT TO DO SUCH A THING IWOULD HAVE BEGGED HIM NOT TO DO IT.AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME TO HER RECOLLECTION THE TALK SHE HAD HAD WITHHER UNCLE AS THEY SAT TOGETHER IN HYDE PARK. SHE REMEMBERED HOW HE HADSPOKEN OF WYNDHAM HOW ANXIOUS HE APPEARED THAT THE OLD PLACE SHOULDREMAIN AS IT WAS AND THE PROMISE SHE HAD GIVEN TO DO ALL IN HER POWERTO KEEP IT UNCHANGED. BUT HE HAD SPOKEN OF ANOTHER MISTRESS OF WYNDHAMEVIDENTLY HIS THOUGHTS HAD TURNED TO HILDA BLAND.DOUBTLESS HE WAS THEN IN A STATE OF INDECISION WITH RESPECT TO THEDISPOSITION OR HIS PROPERTY. HAD HE FINALLY DECIDED TO LET HIS LASTWILL STAND OR HAD DEATH COMING SO UNEXPECTEDLY SETTLED THE QUESTIONFOR HIM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW.YOU CANNOT SET ASIDE YOUR UNCLES WILL SAID MISS LORRAINE.

I SHALL NEVER MARRY SHE SAID WITH DECISION.IT IS A GREAT PITY SAID MISS LORRAINE MUSINGLY IT IS A GREAT PITYYOU AND GUY WERE NOT SUITED TO EACH OTHER.ALDYTH DID NOT REPLY.

THINK HOW PLEASED YOURMOTHER WILL BE.YES SHE WILL BE PLEASED SAID ALDYTH AS IF THE IDEA HAD NOTOCCURRED TO HER BEFORE. BUT HER FACE DID NOT BRIGHTEN.I NEVER WISHED TO BE RICH SHE SAID PRESENTLY IT WILL NOT MAKE MEHAPPIER. ONLY SHE ADDED AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER POOR OVERWORKED GIRLFRIENDS IN LONDON IT WILL GIVE ME THE POWER TO BRIGHTEN OTHER LIVES.THAT IS THE BEST THING ABOUT WEALTH I THINK.BLESS YOU CHILD SAID HER AUNT KISSING HER AGAIN YOU ALWAYS HAVEBRIGHTENED THE LIVES OF OTHERS. YOU HAVE MADE MINE HAPPIER EVER SINCEYOU CAME TO ME AS A TINY CHILD.ALDYTH ROSE AND THREW HER ARMS ABOUT HER AUNT RETURNING HER KISSESWITH INTEREST.AUNT SHE ASKED THE NEXT MINUTE IN A FRIGHTENED WHISPER SHALL IHAVE TO LIVE HERE NOWI DO NOT KNOW DEAR BUT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE YOUR HOME SAID MISSLORRAINE CHEERFULLY.I CAN NEVER BEAR TO LIVE HERE ALONE SAID ALDYTH ALMOST IN TEARS.YOU MUST LIVE HERE WITH ME AUNTIE.WELL WELL DEAR WE WILL SEE IT IS EARLY YET TO MAKE PLANS SAIDMISS LORRAINE SOOTHINGLY. SHE WAS NOT PREPARED TO RENOUNCE ON THEINSTANT HER PRETTY COTTAGE AT WOODHAM.ALDYTH PASSED THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH A STRANGE SENSE OFUNREALITY. SHE WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS LOOKED AT ALL THEQUAINT OLDFASHIONED BELONGINGS SO FAMILIAR TO HER AND TOLD HERSELFTHEY WERE NOW HER OWN BUT IT DID NOT SEEM AS IF IT COULD BE TRUE.SHE HAD NOT MUCH TIME FOR SOLITARY MUSING. THERE WERE MANY THINGS TOBE ARRANGED AND THOUGH NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT THE WILL TILL AFTERTHE FUNERAL EVERY ONE ABOUT THE PLACE SOON SEEMED TO KNOW THAT MISSALDYTHS OPINION WAS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE AND EVERYTHING MUST BEREFERRED TO HER.GUYS BEARING BUT TOO PLAINLY PROCLAIMED THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HISHOPES. IT MADE ALDYTH MISERABLE TO SEE HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HERTO EXPRESS ANY FEELING ON THE SUBJECT. HE CHECKED THE FALTERING WORDSSHE TRIED TO UTTER WITH A COLD PROFESSION THAT HE WAS GLAD THINGS HADTURNED OUT SO WELL FOR HER.WOMEN ARE BETTER DIPLOMATISTS THAN MEN HE SAID SNEERINGLY. THEYARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO WIN THEIR ENDS WITHOUT LOSING FAVOUR AT COURT.THE WORDS STUNG ALDYTH WHO FELT THAT THEY WERE UNJUST. IT HURT HERTOO THAT HILDA SENT HER NO WORD NOR TOOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF HERBEING AT WYNDHAM.SHE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE THAT MOST PERSONS WERE TREATING HER INA NEW MANNER. MR. GREENWOOD THE BANKER ONE OF THE EXECUTORS OF MR.LORRAINES WILL AND HIS BROTHER MR. RALPH BECAME QUITE CEREMONIOUSIN THEIR DEFERENCE TO HER WISHES. THE SERVANTS WHOM SHE REGARDED ASOLD FRIENDS SHOWED AN UNUSUAL ASSIDUITY IN WAITING ON HER. THE RECTOROF WOODHAM SUDDENLY GREW INTERESTED IN HER VIEWS ON VARIOUS QUESTIONSAND THE NEW CURATE IN CHARGE OF THE OLD CHURCH ACTUATED POSSIBLY BYTHE HOPE OF FUTURE SUBSCRIPTIONS CALLED TWICE ERE HER UNCLE HAD BEENDEAD A WEEK. AS FOR HER MOTHER IT WAS WITH A BITTER SENSE OF AMUSEMENTTHAT ALDYTH READ HER CONGRATULATIONS.   MY DARLING CHILD MRS. STANTON WROTEIT MAKES ME SO HAPPY TO KNOWTHAT YOUR LIFELONG DEVOTION TO YOUR GRANDUNCLE HAS MET WITH ITSRIGHT REWARD. YOU DESERVE TO BE RICH AND PROSPEROUS FOR YOU HAVEALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD AND UNSELFISH SO WILLING TO DO ALL IN YOUR POWERTO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY. I CONFESS I TREMBLED WHEN I HEARD HOW YOU HADDISAPPOINTED HIS WISH THAT YOU SHOULD MARRY YOUR COUSIN BUT IT ISPLAIN NOW THAT YOU ACTED FOR THE BEST. OF COURSE HE FEELS IT BUT HE ISA MAN AND CAN MAKE HIS WAY IN THE WORLD IT IS MUCH BETTER YOU SHOULDBE PROVIDED FOR.   WE MISS YOU EVERY DAY. HOW I WISH YOU WERE COMING TO EASTBOURNEWITH US PAPA WILL NOT ACCOMPANY US AFTER ALL. HE HAS RECEIVED SUCHACCOUNTS OF THE STATE OF HIS BUSINESS THAT HE HAS RESOLVED TO RETURN TOMELBOURNE AT ONCE. I AM SORRY FOR HE IS HARDLY FIT TO GO ALONE AND HEWILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING SO SOON. BUT I MUST HOPE FOR THE BEST. ITIS SUCH A COMFORT TO KNOW OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE. DO WRITE AGAIN SOONAND LET ME KNOW WHEN I SHALL SEE YOU.                            YOUR LOVING                                     MOTHER.SO NOTHING NOW WAS TO BE SAID ABOUT HER STUPIDITY AND FOLLY. HERNOTIONS WERE NO LONGER RIDICULOUS. SHE WAS GOOD AND UNSELFISH AND ALLSHE HAD DONE WAS RIGHT.GLADYS HAD ADDED A FEW CHARACTERISTIC LINES.   YOU LUCKY GIRL SHE WROTE. SO YOU HAVE MONEY AND LANDS HORSESCARRIAGES AN ESTABLISHMENT ALL WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF A HUSBAND IFI WERE YOU I WOULD NEVER MARRY BUT ENJOY MY LIBERTY AND DO AS ILIKED. I ALAS CAN ONLY GET A FORTUNE BY SELLING MYSELF. FANCY MAMMASINDIGNATIONTHAT TIRESOME CAPTAIN WALKER IS NOT GOING TO EASTBOURNEAFTER ALL HE FEELS BOUND INSTEAD TO VISIT AN AGED RELATIVE IN ESSEX.I BELIEVE HE BACKED OUT OF IT BECAUSE HE FOUND YOU WERE NOT GOING BUTMAMMA SAYS THAT IS NONSENSE.   I HOPE YOU WILL SOON INVITE ME TO VISIT YOU IN YOUR NEW GRANDEUR.YOU WILL LET ME HAVE A GALLOP ON ONE OF YOUR HORSES WONT YOU ALDYTHDEAR AND ILL VOW THAT YOU ARE THE DEAREST SISTER THAT EVER WAS.ALDYTH COULD SMILE OVER GLADYS WORDS. SHE SHOWED THEM TO HER AUNT WHOSAID AT ONCEYOU SEE YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING SOLITARY IN THIS GREAT HOUSE YOURMOTHER AND SISTER ARE ONLY WAITING FOR AN INVITATION.OH TO BE SURE CRIED ALDYTH HER FACE LIGHTING UP WITH UNEXPECTEDPLEASURE. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT. FANCY MY HAVING MOTHER AND GLADYSHERE AS MY GUESTS I SHOULD LIKE THAT. AND NELLY TOO MUST COME SHEIS SO FOND OF THE COUNTRY. AND CECIL MIGHT COME FOR THE SHOOTING. OHTHAT IS GRANDMISS LORRAINE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE WHAT PLEASURE ALDYTH DERIVED FROMHER SUGGESTION. SHE WONDERED IF IT HAD EVER OCCURRED TO OLD STEPHENTHAT MRS. STANTON MIGHT LARGELY BENEFIT BY ALDYTHS INHERITANCE. IN HISTHOUGHTS OF WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT BRING FORTH HAD HE EVER PICTUREDTHAT FAIR LADY COMING AS A VISITOR TO WYNDHAM PROBABLY NOT. BUT MISSLORRAINE KEPT HER REFLECTIONS TO HERSELF. SHE WOULD NOT CAST A SHADOWON THE FIRST GLEAM OF SATISFACTION ALDYTHS FORTUNE HAD CAUSED HER.AFTER A WEEK FULL OF STRANGE AND EXCITING EXPERIENCES THE CALM REPOSEOF SUNDAY WAS VERY WELCOME TO ALDYTH. SHE DROVE WITH HER AUNT TOWOODHAM CHURCH IN THE MORNING AND HAD AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THATSHE WAS MUCH OBSERVED AS SHE ENTERED THE BUILDING. WHILST AT THE CLOSEOF THE SERVICE MANY OF HER ACQUAINTANCES STUDIED HER FURTIVELY BUTSEEMED SHY OF SPEAKING TO HER.SHE WAS GLAD TO REGAIN THE SHELTER OF THE CARRIAGE AND WAS CONTENTTO FIND HERSELF PASSING ONCE MORE ALONG THE STRAIGHT MONOTONOUS ROADBETWEEN THE QUIET FIELDS.MISS LORRAINE FUSSILY CONSCIOUS OF HER FRESH MOURNING AND THEIMPORTANCE WHICH THEIR BEREAVEMENT GAVE THEM IN THE EYES OF THEIRNEIGHBOURS HAD MUCH TO SAY AND HAD APPARENTLY OBSERVED EVERYINDIVIDUAL WHO HAD ATTENDED THE SERVICE.BUT ALDYTH DID NOT FIND IT NECESSARY TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HERAUNTS REMARKS. A WORD NOW AND THEN WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY MISSLORRAINE AND ALDYTHS THOUGHTS TOOK THEIR OWN COURSE IN THE INTERVALSREVOLVING CHIEFLY ABOUT THE QUERY WHY MR. GLYNNE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ASSHE PASSED OUT OF CHURCH HAD CHOSEN TO STAND AT A DISTANCE LIFTINGHIS HAT CEREMONIOUSLY WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE COME FORWARD WITH A FRIENDSGREETING. HE HAD BEEN SO KIND AND FRIENDLY THE OTHER DAY WAS HE GOINGTO BE DIFFERENT NOWIN THE WARM AFTERNOON ALDYTH WANDERED FROM THE HOUSE AND CROSSING THEGARDEN AND A MEADOW BEYOND APPROACHED A KNOLL OF TREES WHICH SEEMEDTO PROMISE A COOL RETREAT. SEATING HERSELF IN THEIR SHADE SHE THREWDOWN HER HAT AND GAVE A LITTLE SIGH OF RELIEF AT FINDING HERSELF INTHIS COOL QUIET SPOT. ALL ABOUT HER LAY THE GREEN STILL COUNTRYBREATHING A CALM WHICH SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE DAY. THE FIELDS AN WHICHSHE LOOKED DOWN WERE HER FIELDS ALDYTH TOLD HERSELF WITH A FAINTSMILE THOSE WERE HER COWS SHE SAW GOING FORTH INTO THE LANE ON THEIRWAY TO BE MILKED THE WOODS TO THE RIGHT RISING AGAINST THE SKY WEREHER WOODS YES EVEN THAT TINY RABBIT WHICH WHISKED AWAY AS SHE RAISEDHER HAND BELONGED TO HER.THE THOUGHT OF THIS GREAT UNEXPECTED INHERITANCE WEIGHED ON ALDYTHSMIND. HER FATHER HAD GROWN UP WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT AT SOME FUTURETIME IT WOULD BE HIS GUY IN HIS TURN HAD COUNTED HIMSELF THE HEIRBUT SHE TO WHOM WYNDHAM HAD FALLEN HAD NEVER SERIOUSLY IMAGINED THATSUCH A POSSESSION WOULD BE HERS. IT BROUGHT WITH IT A HEAVY BURDEN OFRESPONSIBILITY. WAS IT WELL TO HAVE SO MUCH WHEN MANY LIVES KNEW SUCHWANT AND PRIVATIONHIS POSSESSIONS HAD NOT BROUGHT HER UNCLE HAPPINESS. HE HAD BEEN KINDAND GENEROUS TO HER HE HAD GIVEN GUY A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE BUT IN OTHERQUARTERS HE HAD EARNED THE REPUTATION OF BEING CLOSEFISTED AND IT WASCERTAIN THAT HE HAD NEVER SPENT MUCH ON HIS OWN PLEASURE. ALDYTH HADHEARD IT SAID THAT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SAVING A THIRD OF HIS INCOMEEACH YEAR AND IT WAS OWING TO THIS FACT THAT HER OWN WEALTH WAS NOW SOCONSIDERABLE. AND HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN SO MUCH OF THAT BEST HAPPINESSWHICH SPRINGS FROM MAKING OTHERS HAPPY BUT THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE LOVEIN HIS LIFE. THAT WAS THE PITY OF IT. ALDYTH COULD NOT BUT BE AWARETHAT THERE WERE FEW PERSONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO REALLY REGRETTEDTHE DEATH OF HER GRANDUNCLE.AS SHE THOUGHT OF IT THERE CAME HOME TO HER MORE POWERFULLY THAN EVERBEFORE THE TRUTH THAT LOVE IS THE GREAT SECRET OF LIFE THE VITALLESSON THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF LIFE IS DESTINED TO TEACH US A LESSONWRITTEN BY GOD HIMSELF IN GLOWING CHARACTERS FOR ALL TIME TO READ ONTHE CROSS OF CALVARY.LIFE ALDYTH MURMURED TO HERSELF IN THE WORDS OF HER FAVOURITE POET                        IS ENERGY OF LOVE   DIVINE OR HUMAN EXERCISED IN PAIN   IN STRIFE AND TRIBULATION AND ORDAINED   IF SO APPROVED AND SANCTIFIED TO PASS   THROUGH SHADES AND SILENT REST TO ENDLESS JOY.THEN BENEATH THE RUSTLING TREES WITH THE SWEET SUMMER CALM ABOUT HERALDYTH CAST HERSELF ANEW UPON THE ETERNAL LOVE PRAYING TO BE DELIVEREDFROM VULGAR LUST OF ACQUISITION FROM WORLDLY DESIRES AND AIMS ANDTO BE MADE SO PURE AND LOVING THAT SHE MIGHT NOT MISS THE VISION OFGOD HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH NOR FAIL TO HEAR THE VOICE OF GODSPEAKING TO HER INMOST SOUL.CHAPTER XX.UNWELCOME CHANGES COME IN FORTUNES TRAIN.GOODBYE ALDYTH IM OFF.OFF OFF WHITHER GUY ASKED ALDYTH IN HER ASTONISHMENT LOOKING ATHIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND WITHOUT TAKING IT.SHE HAD BUT JUST FINISHED BREAKFAST. GUY APPARENTLY HAD BREAKFASTEDEARLIER FOR HE STOOD BEFORE HER HAT AND STICK IN HAND. AND NOW ALDYTHPERCEIVED THAT HIS DOGCART STOOD AT THE DOOR AND A SERVANT WASPLACING WHAT SEEMED TO BE LUGGAGE AT THE BACK.I AM GOING TO MY OWN HOUSE SAID GUY STIFFLY. I WAS DOWN THERE ONSATURDAY AND MADE EVERY ARRANGEMENT.THE COLOUR FLEW INTO ALDYTHS FACE. OH GUY WHY SHOULD YOU SHEEXCLAIMED DEEPLY PAINED. SURELY THINGS CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE ENOUGHFOR YOU AT THE FARM AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT REMAINHERE.EXCUSE ME HE SAID PROUDLY YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I SEE STRONGREASONS WHY THIS HOUSE CAN NO LONGER BE MY HOME.OH GUY YOU SPEAK AS IF WE WERE ENEMIES SAID ALDYTH. IS IT MYFAULT THAT WYNDHAM WAS LEFT TO ME YOU KNOW I WOULD RATHER IT HAD NOTBEEN.TO THESE WORDS GUY MADE NO REPLY WHATEVER AND HIS SILENCE WASIRRITATING TO ALDYTH. SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED TO PUT HER IN THE WRONG.BUT SHE CONTROLLED HERSELF AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTIONSYMPATHY OVERCAME IRRITATION.IT IS DREADFULLY TRYING FOR YOU I KNOW GUY SHE SAID. HOW I WISH ICOULD SET IT ALL RIGHT YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK I REJOICE AT WHATHAS HAPPENED.A LOW IMPATIENT EXCLAMATION ESCAPED HER COUSIN.WHY CANNOT YOU STAY ON HERE WITH ME AND AUNT ASKED ALDYTH WITH THEKINDEST INTENTIONS. YOU NEED NOT THINK OF GETTING YOUR OWN HOUSE READYTILL HILDA IS PREPARED TO SHARE IT.IF I WAIT FOR THAT I SHALL WAIT A LONG TIME HE SAID BITTERLY. DOYOU THINK I CAN CONTEMPLATE MARRIAGE ON THE INCOME I SHALL DRAW FROMTHAT WRETCHED FARM I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL. NO THAT DREAM IS OVER.GUY EXCLAIMED ALDYTH STARTLED AND DISTRESSED.IT HAD NOT STRUCK HER THAT HILDAS HAPPINESS MIGHT BE IMPERILLED BYTHE NEW WHOLLY UNLOOKEDFOR TURN OF AFFAIRS. SHE RECOILED AFRESH FROMTHE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF. WILD IDEAS OF SETTING ASIDEHER UNCLES WILL OF INSISTING UPON AN EQUAL DIVISION OF THE PROPERTYOF REFUSING TO LIVE AT WYNDHAM FLITTED THROUGH HER BRAIN ONLY TO BEFOLLOWED BY A KEEN SENSE OF THEIR IMPRACTICABILITY.WHILST THESE THOUGHTS POSSESSED HER GUY AGAIN HELD OUT HIS HAND. SHETOOK IT MECHANICALLY AND THE NEXT INSTANT HE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM.THREE MINUTES LATER SHE SAW HIM DRIVE AWAY FROM THE HOUSE.ALDYTH BURST INTO TEARS. IT WAS HARD TO HAVE TO PAY SUCH A PRICE FOR ANINHERITANCE SHE HAD NEVER DESIRED. SHE BEGAN TO HATE THE WEALTH THATWAS BRINGING SUCH ISOLATION INTO HER LIFE. HER COUSIN THE PLAYMATE OFHER CHILDHOOD WAS DRIVEN FROM THE HOME IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BROUGHTUP HER DEAREST FRIEND WAS ALIENATED FROM HER AND ALL THROUGH NO FAULTOF HER OWN. IT WAS HARD. ALDYTH NEEDED NOT TO BE TOLD THAT SHE HADBECOME A CHIEF CENTRE OF INTEREST IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF WOODHAM. PASTEXPERIENCE MADE HER PERFECTLY AWARE THAT HER NAME WAS CONSTANTLY ON THELIPS OF THE GOSSIPS AND THAT TRUTH WAS LIKELY TO SUFFER IN THE RAPIDEXCHANGE OF IDEAS REGARDING HER THAT WAS GOING ON.BUT SHE WOULD HAVE SMILED HAD SHE KNOWN THE MAGNITUDE TO WHICH HERFORTUNE HAD BEEN BLOWN BY THE BREATH OF RUMOUR. ACCORDING TO SOMEPERSONS THE SAVINGS OF OLD STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD BEEN ENORMOUS ANDHIS NIECE HAD COME INTO POSSESSION OF LITTLE SHORT OF HALF A MILLION.AND TO MAKE THE CONTRAST AS STRIKING AS POSSIBLE GUYS BEQUEST WASPROPORTIONATELY REDUCED. HE HAD BEEN CUT OFF WITH A SHILLING AND THEFARM AT WOOD CORNER WHICH EVERY ONE KNEW DID NOT COMPRISE THE MOSTPRODUCTIVE ACRES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS MR. GLYNNE ASKED CLARA DAWTREY BRAVE INTHE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A FRESH PINK GINGHAM WHICH HE MUST ADMIRE AS SHESTOPPED THAT GENTLEMAN IN THE LONDON ROAD.WHAT NEWS MISS DAWTREY HE ASKED FIXING ON HER HIS PECULIARLYEARNEST GAZE.JOHN GLYNNE HAD THE QUALITY OF BEING A THOROUGH LISTENER. CLARA FOUNDTHE GRAVITY OF HIS EXPRESSION AND THE CLOSE ATTENTION HE WAS PAYING TOHER WORDS RATHER DISCONCERTING AS SHE SAID RAPIDLYOH THE NEWS ABOUT ALDYTH LORRAINE I MEAN. DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE HASBECOME A GREAT HEIRESS OLD STEPHEN SAVED TREMENDOUSLY ALL HIS LIFEAND SHE HAS COME IN FOR NO END OF MONEY. HE WAS AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLETHEY SAY HE WOULD NOT EVEN BUY A NEW SUIT WHEN HIS BROTHER DIED. BUT IDO CALL IT A SHAME THAT SUCH A NICE FELLOW AS GUY SHOULD HAVE NOTHING.IS IT SO ASKED MR. GLYNNE QUIETLY. DOES MR. GUY LORRAINE INHERITNOTHINGOH HE HAS THAT MEAN LITTLE FARM AT WOOD CORNER BUT WHAT IS THAT WHENHE EXPECTED TO BE THE HEIR OF WYNDHAM I AM SORRY FOR HILDA BUT I MUSTSAY IT IS AMUSING TO THINK OF MRS. BLANDS DISAPPOINTMENT. SHE MUSTHAVE CONGRATULATED HERSELF THAT HILDA WAS GOING TO MAKE SUCH A GOODMATCH.THE YOUNG LADY LAUGHED GLEEFULLY BUT NOT A MUSCLE OF JOHN GLYNNESFACE CHANGED. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE HOW HE WAS AFFECTED BY THENEWS JUST OUT IN WOODHAM FOR IT WAS THE EVENING OF THE DAY ON WHICHOLD MR. LORRAINES FUNERAL HAD TAKEN PLACE.I WOULD NOT BE ALDYTH LORRAINE FOR ANYTHING CONTINUED MISS DAWTREYSTILL UNEASY BENEATH MR. GLYNNES GAZE. I SHOULD FEEL ODIOUS TAKINGEVERYTHING LIKE THAT. AND IN MANY WAYS IT MUST BE HATEFUL TO BE ANHEIRESS. I SHOULD FEEL SURE THAT EVERY MAN WHO ASKED ME TO MARRY HIMONLY WANTED ME FOR MY MONEY. BUT THE MAN WHO MARRIES ALDYTH WILL FINDTHAT HE CANNOT DO AS HE LIKES WITH HER MONEY OLD STEPHEN HAS TIED ITUP TIGHTLY. BUT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED HER COUSIN. I SHALL ALWAYSSAY THAT. EVERY ONE EXPECTED IT OF HER.IS A YOUNG LADY BOUND TO FULFIL THE EXPECTATIONS OTHER PEOPLE HAVEFORMED CONCERNING HER ASKED MR. GLYNNE WITH A SLIGHT SMILE.NOT AT ALL SAID CLARA READILY FOR MY PART I MAKE A POINT OFDOING THE REVERSE THERE IS NOTHING I ENJOY MORE THAN ASTONISHINGPEOPLE. BUT ALDYTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD AND PROPER.JOHN GLYNNE LIFTED HIS HAT AND MOVED ON WITHOUT SAYING MORE THOUGH HEWONDERED AT THE IDEA OF GOODNESS SUGGESTED BY MISS DAWTREYS WORDS.THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS PASSING MYRTLE COTTAGE WHICH WITH ITSCLOSELYDRAWN BLINDS HAD A DESERTED AIR. EVEN THE LITTLE HOUSEMAIDLOOKED FORLORN AS SHE STOOD IN THE FRONT GARDEN WATERING THEGERANIUMS. THE MEMORY OF PLEASANT EVENINGS SPENT WITHIN THOSE WALLSCAME TO HIM WITH A PAINFUL REMINDER THAT THE PLEASURE WAS NOT LIKELYTO BE RENEWED. ALDYTH WOULD NEVER RETURN TO MAKE HER HOME IN THECOTTAGE. THE VISION OF HER RICH COURTED REMOVED TO A DISTANCE FROMHIMSELF ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND. THE WEALTH SHE HAD INHERITED WOULD BE ANIMPASSABLE BARRIER DIVIDING THEM.THE NEWS HAD COME AS A BLOW TO HIM BUT HE RALLIED HIMSELF TO BEAR ITBRAVELY. TILL THIS MOMENT HE HAD HARDLY BEEN AWARE HOW STRONG WERE THENEW HOPES THAT HAD SPRUNG UP IN HIS HEART FROM THE HOUR WHEN HE KNEWTHAT GUY LORRAINE HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER BRIDE. THEY MUST BE CRUSHED NOW.IT IS WELL THAT I KNOW IN TIME HE SAID TO HIMSELF. WELL THAT SHECAN HAVE NO IDEA OF ALL THAT SHE IS TO ME FOR IT WOULD BE PREPOSTEROUSFOR A POOR TUTOR TO APPROACH AS A SUITOR THE HEIRESS OF WYNDHAM.BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE SUGGESTION WHICH CAME WITH THEMEMORY OF HER LAST GLANCE AS SHE DROVE FROM THE STATION THAT POSSIBLYUNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE MIGHT HAVE WON HER LOVE. JOHN PAUSEDAND WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED ON THE TOP OF A GATE AND HIS UNSEEING EYESGAZING ACROSS THE FIELDS PICTURED TO HIMSELF IN IMAGINATION WHAT THISCHANGE MIGHT MEAN FOR ALDYTH. HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HER ELATED BY THISSUDDEN DOWER OF WEALTH. IT WAS EASIER TO THINK OF HER AS SHRINKING FROMITS BURDEN AND FEARFUL OF HERSELF LEST SHE SHOULD FAIL TO DISCHARGEARIGHT THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY.WOULD IT MAKE HER HAPPIER HARDLY FOR SHE WAS NOT ONE TO PRIZEMATERIAL PROSPERITY. HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE SHE HAD A CHILDLIKEENJOYMENT OF THE COMMON THINGS OF LIFE. HE THOUGHT HER ONE OF THE LEASTWORLDLY OF WOMEN. WAS THERE ANY REAL DANGER OF HER GIVING HERSELF TO AWORTHLESS FORTUNEHUNTER HE COULD NOT THINK IT. HER PURE STRONG FACERISING BEFORE HIS MENTAL VISION SEEMED TO DECLARE THE IDEA ABSURD. THEMAN WHO WON HER MUST BE WORTHY OF HER LOVE AND CONFIDENCE.GOD BLESS HER GLYNNE SAID WITHIN HIS HEART. AY AND HE WILL BLESSHER FOR SHE IS AS PURE AND GOOD AND UNSELFISH AS AN ANGEL ANDWHATEVER HER LOT MAY BE SHE WILL MAKE OTHERS BETTER AND HAPPIER.BUT THOUGH HE HAD SO HIGH AN OPINION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED THOUGH HEHELD HER EXALTED ABOVE ALL VULGAR CONVENTIONAL NOTIONS AND ASPIRATIONSONE TO PRIZE HER WOMANHOOD MORE HIGHLY THAN HER WEALTH HIS PRIDE YETSAW IN HER FORTUNE AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE TO HIS EVER OFFERING HERHIS LOVE.HILDA SAID KITTY BLAND TO HER SISTER TWO DAYS LATER MOTHER ISGOING TO DRIVE TO WYNDHAM THIS AFTERNOON. I SUPPOSE YOU WILL GO WITHHER TO SEE ALDYTHTHEY WERE IN THE GARDEN. HILDA WAS STRETCHED COMFORTABLY IN THEHAMMOCK AND KITTY SEATED ON A CHAIR UNDER THE TREES WITH A BASIN INHER LAP AND A BASKET BY HER SIDE WAS ENRAGED IN THE HOMELY OCCUPATIONOF SHELLING PEAS.I SHALL DO NO SUCH THING SAID HILDA PETTISHLY. IT IS LIKE YOU TOSUGGEST IT KITTY. HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN BEAR TO GO TO WYNDHAMVERY EASILY SAID KITTY IN HER MOST MATTEROFFACT TONE. YOU ALWAYSHAVE LIKED GOING THERE AND I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD LIKE IT BETTERNOW THAT ALDYTH IS AT WYNDHAM AND NOT THAT DREADFUL OLD MR. LORRAINE.OH YES I KNOW ITS BAD FORM TO SPEAK THE TRUTH OF PEOPLE WHEN THEYARE DEAD BUT HE WAS HORRID. HE WAS FOR EVER ANNOYING PEOPLE WHILST HELIVED AND HE DID HIS BEST TO MAKE THINGS UNCOMFORTABLE ALL ROUND WHENHE WAS GONE.HE TREATED GUY SHAMEFULLY SAID HILDA WITH EMPHASIS. AFTER THENOBLE WAY IN WHICH GUY SAVED HIS LIFE IT WAS TOO BAD I CAN NEVER BEARTO SEE WYNDHAM AGAINTHE PLACE THAT I USED TO THINK WOULD BE MY HOME.YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT SO LONG SAID KITTY COOLLY IT IS BARELY THREEMONTHS SINCE YOU BECAME ENGAGED. AND AS I SO OFTEN TELL YOU YOUSHOULD NOT COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY ARE HATCHED.AT THAT RATE ONE SHOULD NEVER LOOK FORWARD TO ANYTHING SAID HILDADISCONTENTEDLY.WELL IT IS BETTER NOT SAID KITTY. BUT REALLY THE HOUSE AT WOODCORNER IS VERY NICE HILDA A MUCH MORE CHEERFUL PLACE THAN WYNDHAMWHICH WITH THAT POND AND SO MANY TREES ABOUT THE HOUSE ALWAYS STRIKESME AS GLOOMY.OH KITTY IT IS LOVELY AT NIGHT TO SEE THE MOON SHINING ON THE PONDAND THE NIGHTINGALES SING SO BEAUTIFULLY IN THE TREESAH I FORGOT YOU ARE ROMANTIC AWL ENJOY THAT SORT OF THINGREMARKED KITTY. YOU WOULD LIKE TO LIVE LIKE MARIANA IN A MOATEDGRANGE.OH DONT SPEAK OF THAT SAID HILDA WITH A SHIVER. I HOPE I MAYNEVER BE AS WRETCHED AS MARIANA THOUGH SOMETIMES I THINKSHE DID NOT FINISH HER SENTENCE. KITTY SAW THAT TEARS WERE IN HERSISTERS EYES AND TRIED TO CHEER HER BY SAYING BRISKLYWELL I MEANTO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS. I AM VERY SORRY FOR GUYS DISAPPOINTMENTAND ALL THAT BUT SINCE HE WAS NOT TO HAVE THE PROPERTY I AM GLAD ITHAS COME TO OUR DEAR OLD ALDYTH. FANCY HER OWNING ALL THOSE HORSESTHATS A GOOD THING FOR ME I KNOW. SHE WILL GIVE ME A MOUNT WHENEVER IWANT ONE. HOW I WISH SHE WENT IN FOR HUNTING THAT WE MIGHT FOLLOW THEHOUNDS TOGETHERYOU THINK OF NOTHING BUT YOUR OWN PLEASURE KITTY SAID HILDAIMPATIENTLY. FOR MY PART I AM DISGUSTED WITH ALDYTH I CAN NEVER FEELTOWARDS HER AS I USED.WHY WHAT HAS ALDYTH DONE ASKED KITTY IN THE UTMOST ASTONISHMENT.IT IS NOT HER FAULT THAT HER UNCLE LEFT HER THE PROPERTY.I AM NOT SO SURE OF THAT SAID HILDA. GUY THINKS SHE MUST HAVEKNOWN AND SHE MIGHT HAVE USED HER INFLUENCE ON HIS BEHALF.WHAT NONSENSE EXCLAIMED KITTY WARMLY. WHEN DID YOU KNOW MR.STEPHEN LORRAINE ALLOW ANY ONE TO INFLUENCE HIM HE ALWAYS DID AS HELIKED. I AM SURPRISED THAT YOU SHOULD SAY SUCH A THING OF ALDYTH. AFTERALL YOUR PROFESSIONS OF FRIENDSHIP TOO YOU OUGHT TO KNOW HER BETTERTHAN TO SUPPOSE THAT SHE WOULD WILLINGLY SUPPLANT GUYBUT HILDA WOULD NOT TAKE BACK HER WORDS NOR WOULD SHE BE PERSUADEDTO ACCOMPANY THEIR MOTHER TO WYNDHAM. SHE REMAINED AT HOME SULKY ANDMISERABLE WHILST KITTY AND MRS. BLAND WENT TO SEE ALDYTH.MRS. BLAND WOULD HAVE BEEN WANTING IN THE NATURAL FEELINGS OF A MOTHERIF SHE HAD NOT LAMENTED GUYS ALTERED PROSPECTS. SHE CONSIDERED THATTHE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY TREATED FOR ALTHOUGH OLD STEPHEN HADBEEN VERY GUARDED IN THE CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH HER WHEN HE YIELDEDHIS CONSENT TO AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN HILDA AND GUY HIS MANNER HADCONVEYED TO HER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE MEANT THAT HIS GRANDNEPHEWSHOULD BE HIS HEIR. THE UNEXPECTED TURN OF AFFAIRS CONSEQUENT ON MR.LORRAINES DECEASE CAUSED HER CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY BUT SHE NEVERTHOUGHT OF BLAMING ALDYTH IN THE MATTER. SHE RATHER FELT THAT THE GIRLWAS TO BE PITIED FOR SHE FORESAW THAT ALDYTHS INHERITANCE WOULD BRINGWITH IT CARES AND DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD WEIGH HEAVILY ON HER YOUNGHEART.SO ALDYTH SAW NO CHANGE IN THE FACE OF HER OLD FRIEND AND FELT SHE WASSTILL DEAR TO THE MOTHERLY HEART WHICH HAD TAUGHT HER TO PLACE SO HIGHA VALUE ON THE FILIAL BOND.DEAR MRS. BLAND SHE SAID AT ONCE SURE OF HER SYMPATHY I DONTTHINK YOU NEED TO BE TOLD THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER NOT HAVE HADWYNDHAM. IT IS A REAL PAIN TO ME THAT GUY SHOULD GO AWAY AND I SHOULDBE ESTABLISHED HERE. I WOULD REVERSE OUR POSITIONS IF I COULD.I DO NOT WISH THEM REVERSED SAID MRS. BLAND AN EQUAL DIVISION OFTHE PROPERTY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT THING IN MY OPINION. I ALWAYSTHOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE A HANDSOME LEGACY ALDYTH FOR YOUR FATHER WASVERY DEAR TO MR. LORRAINE AND CONTINUED TO BE SO TO THE END I BELIEVEIN SPITE OF THAT UNHAPPY ESTRANGEMENT.UNCLE ONCE SPOKE TO ME ABOUT WYNDHAM SAID ALDYTH AND I PROMISEDHIM I WOULD USE ANY INFLUENCE I HAD TO PREVENT THE OLD PLACE FROM BEINGGREATLY ALTERED AFTER HIS DEATH BUT I AM SURE ALTHOUGH HE SPOKE INTHAT WAY I NEVER DREAMED THAT HE MEANT TO LEAVE THE PLACE TO ME.OF COURSE NOT MY DEAR HOW SHOULD YOU SAID MRS. BLAND. WELL ITIS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR GUY BUT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WILLBE NONE THE WORSE FOR HAVING TO WORK HARDER AND DEPEND MORE UPONHIMSELF. HIS MARRIAGE MUST BE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED BUT THEY AREYOUNG AND A LENGTHENED PROBATION WILL BE A GOOD TEST OF THEIR LOVE.HILDA POOR CHILD CANNOT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT. BUT HERE COME SOME MOREVISITORSCLARA DAWTREY AND HER FATHER I DECLARE YOU WILL HAVE ALLWOODHAM OUT HERE THIS WEEK ALDYTH.I COULD DISPENSE WITH MUCH OF THIS CIVILITY SAID ALDYTH SMILING. IHATE TO BE TREATED US IF I WERE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT FROM MY FORMER SELF.I DO HOPE MY FRIENDS WILL NOT CHANGE TOWARDS ME.THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO DO THAT AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN WHAT YOU ARESAID MRS. BLAND KISSING HER.BUT ALDYTH SOON LEARNED WITH SORROW THAT HILDAS LOVE FOR HER HADCOOLED AND PERHAPS THE CHANGE WHICH SHE DISCERNED IN ANOTHER FRIENDCOST HER STILL DEEPER PAIN. MR. GLYNNE WAS NOT AMONGST THOSE WHOTRAVERSED THE FIVE STRAIGHT MILES OF DUSTY ROAD TO PAY THEIR RESPECTSTO THE HEIRESS OF WYNDHAM. ALDYTH HARDLY EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD COMEUNLESS INVITED BUT WHEN SOME WEEKS LATER SHE CHANCED TO MEET HIM ATMRS. GREENWOODS THERE WAS SUCH A LACK OF THE OLD FRIENDLINESS IN HISMANNER AS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO RESPOND TO HIS GRAVE POLITENESSEXCEPT WITH A COURTESY EQUALLY DISTANT.HAD ANY ONE TOLD JOHN GLYNNE THAT HE HAD SPOKEN COLDLY TO ALDYTHLORRAINE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED. HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF ANINWARD EXCITEMENT ON SEEING HER THAT FORCED HIM TO EXERCISE STRONGSELFCONTROL. WHILST TALKING TO OTHERS HE THOUGHT ONLY OF HER ANDNOTHING THAT SHE SAID OR DID ESCAPED HIS NOTICE. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLEFOR ALDYTH TO KNOW THIS. SHE WAS CONSCIOUS ONLY THAT HE REMAINED ALOOFFROM HER AND WHEN OTHERS WERE PAYING HER CONSIDERABLE ATTENTIONAPPEARED INDIFFERENT TO HER PRESENCE.WHEN HE QUITTED THE DRAWING ROOM WITHOUT HAVING ATTEMPTED TO EXCHANGE AWORD WITH HER ALDYTHS HEART THROBBED WITH PAINFUL RESENTMENT.WHY SHOULD HE BE DIFFERENT TO ME NOW SHE ASKED HERSELF. I NEVERNEEDED A FRIEND MORE THAN I DO AT THIS TIME AND HE IS SO WISE ANDGOOD HE COULD ADVISE ME HE COULD HELP ME. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGSI SHOULD LIKE TO SAY TO HIM BUT I CANNOT UTTER A WORD WHEN HE LOOKSAT ME IN THAT GRAVE SEVERE WAY. OH I DID THINK I COULD REST ON HISFRIENDSHIP BUT THAT TOO IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM ME.CHAPTER XXI.GUY MAKES A DISCOVERY.ALDYTH DID NOT REMAIN AT WYNDHAM FOR MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER HER UNCLESDEATH. THERE WAS SOMETHING OPPRESSIVE IN THE QUIETNESS OF THE OLDHOUSE WHERE GUYS GAY VOICE AND WHISTLE AND THE STIR OF HIS COMINGSAND GOINGS WERE GREATLY MISSED AND MISS LORRAINE THOUGH SHE DROVEINTO THE LITTLE TOWN ALMOST EVERY DAY PINED FOR THE NEIGHBOURLYINTERESTS OF HER LIFE AT WOODHAM.LET US GO BACK TO THE COTTAGE AUNTIE ALDYTH SAID WE SHALL FEELSO MUCH MORE AT HOME THERE AND WE CAN COME OUT HERE CONSTANTLY TO SEETHAT THINGS ARE ALL RIGHT THOUGH THERE IS NO DOUBT MRS. ROGERS WILLKEEP EVERYTHING IN PERFECT ORDER. YES LET ME GO HOME WITH YOU TILLMOTHER AND GLADYS CAN COME TO ME. THEN I WILL RETURN AND ENDEAVOUR TORIGHTLY DISCHARGE MY DUTIES AS THE MISTRESS OF WYNDHAM.THIS SUGGESTION WAS SO ENTIRELY TO MISS LORRAINES MIND THAT SHE WASAT ONCE CONVINCED OF ITS WISDOM. ALDYTH WAS IN NO WAY BOUND TO TAKE UPHER ABODE AT THE HALL FORTHWITH. SO A DAY OR TWO LATER SHE WAS AGAINDOMICILED IN HER AUNTS HOME OCCUPYING HER OLD BEDROOM AND TAKING UPWITH A NEW ZEST BORN OF A SENSE OF IMPERMANENCE THE SIMPLE HOMELYDUTIES SHE HAD ALWAYS PERFORMED. SHE WAS LIVING THE OLD LIFE AGAIN BUTTHE FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS ONLY MADE HER THE MORE CONSCIOUS OF A CERTAINCHANGE IN HERSELF. THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAD ENLARGED HER KNOWLEDGE OFLIFE SOME HOPES HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED SOME ILLUSIONS SWEPT AWAY ANDCERTAIN GRIM REALITIES BELONGING TO HUMAN LIVES HAD BEEN PAINFULLYTHRUST UPON HER NOTICE.AS SHE SAT AT HER WRITINGTABLE OLD THOUGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEOBJECTS THAT MET HER VIEW CAME BACK TO HER WITH SOMEWHAT OF PAIN INTHEIR MEMORY THE FUTURE SO DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EXPECTEDINSPIRED HER WITH SOME DREAD YET THROUGH ALL HER INNER NATURE KEPTITS DEEP CALM. HER HEART WAS TOO SOUND FOR ANY DISAPPOINTMENT TO RENDERHER CYNICAL. PERHAPS IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT NO EXPERIENCE CANEMBITTER THE HEART OF A WOMAN WHO IS SET UPON LIVING THE HIGHEST LIFEPOSSIBLE TO HER AND WHO THINKS LESS OF WINNING HAPPINESS FOR HERSELFTHAN OF BESTOWING IT ON OTHERS.ALDYTH HAD NOT LONG RETURNED TO WOODHAM WHEN AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICHCAST A SHADOW ON THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE LITTLE TOWN. MRS. GREENWOODTHE BANKERS BRIGHT CLEVER WIFE HAD NEVER BEEN A STRONG WOMAN THOUGHHER REMARKABLE ENERGY HID THE FACT FROM ORDINARY ACQUAINTANCES. HERSUDDEN DEATH FROM AN UNSUSPECTED HEART DISEASE WAS A SAD SHOCK TO HERFRIENDS. A WOMAN OF KEEN INTELLECT AND CULTURED TASTES SHE HAD TAKENTHE GREATEST INTEREST IN MR. GLYNNES LECTURES AND DONE HER UTMOST TOMAKE THEM A SUCCESS. SHE WAS READY TO LEND HER HELP TO ANY SCHEME THATWOULD PROMOTE THE SOCIAL WELFARE OF THE TOWN. WITHOUT CHILDREN OF HEROWN SHE FOUND INTENSE ENJOYMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE ANDMANY A PARTY OF THEM SHE GATHERED IN HER LARGE DRAWING ROOM OR IN THEFINE OLD GARDEN WHICH LAY BEHIND THE BANK. ALDYTH LORRAINE HAD BEEN AGREAT FAVOURITE WITH HER AND THE GIRL FELT THAT SHE HAD LOST A FRIENDWHOM SHE COULD ILL SPARE.MUCH SYMPATHY WAS FELT FOR MR. GREENWOOD A MAN VERGING UPON SIXTYYEARS OF AGE WHOSE HOME MUST NOW BE SO DESOLATE.IT WAS MANIFESTED ON THE FUNERAL DAY WHEN MANY PERSONS MET IN THEPRETTY CEMETERY JUST BEYOND THE TOWN ON THE LONDON ROAD TO SEE THECOFFIN WITH ITS PALL OF FLOWERS LOWERED INTO THE EARTH. ALDYTH HADCOME WITH HER AUNT AND THE BRIEF SERVICE OVER SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OFKITTY BLAND STANDING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHO BECKONED TO HER TO JOINHER.LET US WAIT TILL THE OTHERS HAVE GONE SHE SAID AS ALDYTH APPROACHEDHER I DONT WANT TO WALK BACK WITH THEM AND HEAR THEM TALKING ITOVER.WILLINGLY SAID ALDYTH AND THEY TURNED TO THE MORE SECLUDED PART OFTHE CEMETERY AND SAT DOWN IN THE SHADE OF SOME OLD ELMS.MISS LORRAINE WHO DID ENJOY TALKING IT OVER HAD WALKED ON WITHACQUAINTANCES.SO HILDA HAS NOT COME SAID ALDYTH.NO SAID KITTY DRILY. SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT BEAR TO GO TO A FUNERALSHE IS SO SENSITIVE THE IMPRESSION REMAINS WITH HER FOR DAYS.I DID NOT WISH TO COME SAID ALDYTH BUT AUNT SAID SHE THOUGHT ITWOULD SEEM KIND TO MR. GREENWOOD THOUGH I AM QUITE SURE HE COULD NOTNOTICE WHO WERE HERE. I DO NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE DEAR MRS. GREENWOODWITH THE GRAVE. SHE WAS SO BRIGHT AND GOOD SHE SEEMED ALL SPIRIT ANDI TRY TO THINK OF HER AS HAVING ENTERED UPON A FREER AND MORE BLESSEDSTATE OF EXISTENCE.YES THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK OF HER SAID KITTY. I WILL TELLYOU WHAT MR. GLYNNE SAID THE OTHER DAY I THOUGHT IT WAS SO NICE OFHIM. HE OVERTOOK ME AS I WAS COMING UP THE STREET AND WE WALKED A FEWSTEPS TOGETHER. WE MET LITTLE DOTTIE GREENWOOD AND HER NURSE AND THECHILDYOU KNOW HOW FOND SHE IS OF HIMRAN UP TO HIM AND SAID WITH SUCHA SORROWFUL LOOK ON HER SWEET LITTLE FACEDEAR AUNT MARY IS SO ILL THAT SHE IS DEAD.BUT SHE IS NOT ILL NOW HE SAID AS HE KISSED HER AUNT MARY ISQUITE WELL NOW.AND DOTTIE SMILED AND REPEATED YES AUNT MARY IS QUITE WELL NOW.IT TOUCHED ME SO SOMEHOW AND YET HE ONLY SAID WHAT WE ALL PROFESS TOBELIEVE. MR. GLYNNE IS VERY GOOD DONT YOU THINKI AM SURE OF IT ALDYTH SAID AND WAS SILENT. SHE NEVER SAID MANYWORDS ABOUT JOHN GLYNNE.HE MUST FEEL MRS. GREENWOODS DEATH VERY MUCH CONTINUED KITTY. SHEWAS A GOOD FRIEND TO HIM AND HE WAS OFTEN AT HER HOUSE.ALDYTH HAD MORE THAN ONCE HEARD MRS. GREENWOOD PROFESS A HIGH REGARDFOR JOHN GLYNNE BUT SHE DID NOT REMARK ON IT.MOTHER SAYS SHE IS THANKFUL MR. GLYNNE CAME TO WOODHAM CONTINUEDKITTY. CHARLIE HAS SO IMPROVED. IT IS WONDERFUL HOW FOND THE BOYS AREOF MR. GLYNNE AND WHAT INFLUENCE HE HAS OVER THEM. HE NEVER SEEMS TOLECTURE THEM BUT HE HAS A KNACK OF SAYING JUST THE RIGHT WORD AT THERIGHT TIME. AND THEN I THINK HIS EXAMPLE IMPRESSES THEM. HE IS SUCH APERFECT GENTLEMAN THOUGH REALLY I BELIEVE IT IS HIGHER PRAISE TO SAYTHAT HE IS A THOROUGH MANSO STRONG AND TRUE AND BRAVE.   HIS LIFE WAS GENTLE AND THE ELEMENTS    SO MIXED IN HIM THAT NATURE MIGHT STAND UP    AND SAY TO ALL THE WORLD THIS WAS A MANTHOUGHT ALDYTH. BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE KITTY THE BENEFIT OF THEQUOTATION. SHE WAS CONTENT TO CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO THE CONVERSATIONWHEN IT REACHED THIS POINT BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE SUBJECT OF ITWAS UNINTERESTING TO HER.GUY WAS NOT HERE REMARKED KITTY AFTER A PAUSE. I THOUGHT HE WOULDBE. I WONDER IF HE WILL HONOUR HILDA WITH A VISIT THIS EVENING.KITTYS MANNER OF SAYING THIS WAS SO PECULIAR THAT ALDYTH LOOKED AT HERIN SOME SURPRISE.HONOUR HILDA SHE SAID. THATS A STRANGE EXPRESSION TO USE KITTY.I DO BELIEVE HE REGARDS HIS VISITS AS AN HONOUR SAID KITTY WITHSCORN IN HER TONE. I WOULD NOT PUT UP WITH SUCH A LOVER IF I WEREHILDA.WHY WHAT IS AMISS WITH HIM ASKED ALDYTH QUICKLY.OH IT MAKES ME WILD TO SEE THE WAY HE TREATS HILDA SAID KITTYWITH SUDDEN WARMTH. HE KEEPS AWAY FROM HER FOR DAYS HE SHOWS THEUTMOST INDIFFERENCE TO HER WISHES HE MAKES IT ONLY TOO PLAIN THAT HISFEELINGS TOWARDS HER HAVE CHANGED AND HE MEANS HER TO UNDERSTAND THATIT IS SO.OH KITTY YOU DONT SAY SO EXCLAIMED ALDYTH HER VOICE FULL OFPAIN. YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN. WHY HE WAS SO FOND OF HILDA THAT HERISKED UNCLES ANGER FOR HER SAKE.AH YES BUT HE NEVER EXPECTED TO LOSE ALL FOR LOVE REPLIED KITTY.HIS LOVE COULD NOT STAND THAT TRIAL. HE HAS NEVER BEEN THE SAME TOHILDA SINCE MR. LORRAINE DIED.THEN HIS WAS NOT TRUE LOVE SAID ALDYTH INDIGNANTLY. SUCH LOVE ISNOT WORTHY OF THE NAME.SO I THINK SAID KITTY. IF I WERE HILDA I WOULD SOON TELL MYGENTLEMAN TO MARCH. I REALLY BELIEVE HE WANTS HER TO BREAK OFF THEENGAGEMENT BUT SHE WILL NOT SEE IT.POOR HILDA SAID ALDYTH. OH IT IS DISGRACEFUL OF GUY I DID THINKHE REALLY CARED FOR HILDA.KITTY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS.PRESERVE ME FROM SUCH A LOVER SHE SAID. I AM SORRY FOR HILDA BUTREALLY I FEEL OUT OF PATIENCE WITH HER SOMETIMES. SHE OUGHT TO SEE THETRUE STATE OF THINGS BUT SHE ONLY CHERISHES HER WOUNDED FEELINGSAND THINKS HERSELF THE MOST UNHAPPY OF GIRLS. SHE SAID THIS MORNINGSHE WISHED SHE WERE GOING TO BE LAID IN THE GRAVE INSTEAD OF MRS.GREENWOOD.OH IT IS VERY SAD FOR HER SAID ALDYTH TEARS SPRINGING TO HER EYES.I FEEL ALMOST AS IF IT WERE MY FAULT AND YETAND YETIF GUY CAN SOEASILY CHANGE IT IS BETTER SHE SHOULD KNOW IT NOW.THAT IS WHAT MOTHER AND I SAY REMARKED KITTY BUT OF COURSE WE DARENOT HINT AT SUCH A THING TO HILDA. WE HAVE TO IGNORE THAT THERE ISANYTHING WRONG. BUT I DO WISH SHE WOULD PLUCK UP SPIRIT AND ACT AS SHESHOULD. IF SHE WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE HER ALITTLE ADVICE.BUT ALDYTH KNEW THAT HILDA WAS NOT LIKELY TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT WITHHER. CONFIDENCES BETWEEN THEM HAD CEASED. WITH HER RETURN TO WOODHAMALDYTH HAD RESUMED THE OLD FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE WITH THE BLANDS BUTSHE COULD NOT BREAK DOWN THE BARRIER OF COLDNESS AND CONSTRAINT BYWHICH HILDA KEPT HER AT ARMS LENGTH.KITTY SAID ALDYTH A LITTLE LATER AS THEY TOOK THEIR WAY DOWN THEHILL I AM GOING TO WYNDHAM EARLY TOMORROW. COULD YOU GO WITH ME ANDSPEND THE DAY WE WOULD HAVE A RIDE IN THE AFTERNOON THE HORSES MUSTNEED EXERCISE.OH ALDYTH HOW GOOD OF YOU OF COURSE I CAN COME SAID KITTYDELIGHTED. I HAVE BEEN LONGING FOR A RIDE. AND YOU WONT TELL MOTHERIF I TRY SOME OF THE FENCES WILL YOU ILL PROMISE NOT TO BREAK MYNECK.THAT IS MORE THAN YOU CAN PROMISE SAID ALDYTH LAUGHING.THE HOT JULY AND AUGUST DAYS PASSED PLEASANTLY AWAY AND WERE SPENTSO MUCH IN THE OLD MANNER THAT ALDYTH WAS OFTEN ABLE TO FORGET THATSHE WAS THE HEIRESS OF WYNDHAM. GWENDOLEN BLAND HAD COME HOME FOR HERHOLIDAYS DETERMINED TO PUT AS MUCH ENJOYMENT INTO THEM AS POSSIBLE.THERE WERE TENNISPARTIES AND PICNICS BOATING ON THE RIVER BOTHIN SUNSHINE AND BY MOONLIGHT SCHOOL TREATS FLOWER SHOWS HARVESTFESTIVALS AND ALL THE VARIOUS ENTERTAINMENTS COMMON TO COUNTRY LIFE TOBE PARTICIPATED IN. IT WAS A VEXATION TO CLARA DAWTREY THAT MR. GLYNNEWAS NOT ON THE GROUND TO SEE HOW WELL SHE PLAYED HER PART IN THEANNUAL TOURNAMENT GIVEN BY THE WOODHAM TENNIS CLUB BUT HE HAD LEFT THETOWN WHEN THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL HOLIDAYS BEGAN AND WOULD NOT RETURN TILLSEPTEMBER.ALDYTH RECEIVED BRIGHT LETTERS FROM EASTBOURNE WHERE HER MOTHER ANDGLADYS WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME. NELLY WHO MISSED ALDYTH AND COULDHARDLY FORGIVE HER FOR REFUSING AN INVITATION TO JOIN THEM WAS LESSCONTENT. IT HAD BEEN DECIDED THAT MRS. STANTON AND GLADYS WERE TO VISITWYNDHAM IN THE AUTUMN BUT NO DATE HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THEIR COMINGAND AT PRESENT THEY SEEMED DISPOSED TO STAY ON AT EASTBOURNE INTOSEPTEMBER. ALDYTH WAS LOOKING FORWARD WITH PLEASURE TO WELCOMING HERMOTHER AND TOOK TROUBLE TO GET THE HOUSE AND GARDEN AT WYNDHAM INTO ASNICE ORDER AS POSSIBLE SO AS TO PLEASE HER MOTHERS EYES.DO YOU THINK I MIGHT HAVE THE FURNITURE RECOVERED AUNTIE SHE SAIDONE AFTERNOON WHEN SHE AND MISS LORRAINE WERE IN THE OLD DRAWING ROOMAT WYNDHAM. I CANT HAVE A NEW CARPET AND NEW CURTAINS WITHOUT HAVINGSOMETHING DONE TO THE CHAIRS AND SOFAS.I WOULD BUY NEW FURNITURE IF I WERE YOU SAID MISS LORRAINE. UNCLEOFTEN TALKED OF REFURNISHING THIS ROOM.YES WHEN GUY WAS MARRIED SAID ALDYTH WITH A SMILE. I DONT THINKANYTHING LESS THAN A WEDDING WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH AN OUTLAY. BUT REALLYI HAVE NO WISH TO BANISH THESE SPINDLELEGGED CHAIRS THEY ARE QUITEIN CORRECT HIGH ART STYLE AND AS FOR THAT CARVED EBONY CHAIR IBELIEVE IT WOULD FETCH A HUNDRED GUINEAS AT CHRISTIES. WHEN I GET MYBLUEGREEN UPHOLSTERY AND AN ORIENTAL CARPET YOU WONT KNOW THE ROOM.IT WILL BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT NO DOUBT SAID MISS LORRAINETHERES SOME OLD BLUE CHINA IN THE STOREROOM YOU MIGHT MAKE USE OFFOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES.THE VERY THING CRIED ALDYTH GLEEFULLY.SHE WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE SOME PLEASURE IN HER POSSESSIONS. SHE HADFINE TASTE AND AN ARTISTIC SENSE OF COLOUR IT WAS AN ENJOYMENT TOHER TO PLAN THE REARRANGEMENT OF HER DRAWING ROOM. SHE HAD DRAGGEDTHE LARGE OLDFASHIONED SETTEE FROM ITS PLACE AGAINST THE WALL SHEHAD PUSHED THE EBONY CHAIR WELL INTO THE LIGHT AND THROWN THE FADEDANTIMACASSAR WHICH COVERED IT ON TO THE FLOOR WHEN THE SOUND OF AQUICK FIRM STEP IN THE HALL SURPRISED HER.WHY THAT IS NEVER GUY SHE SAID I FANCIED HE HAD VOWED NOT TOCROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE HALL AGAIN.IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE HIS STEP SAID MISS LORRAINE AND SHEHASTILY OPENED THE DOOR.IT WAS GUY AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY.ALDYTH COLOURED. SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THAT HE SHOULD NOT FIND HERTURNING THINGS ABOUT IN THE OLD DRAWING ROOM. IT MUST BE PAINFUL TO HIMTO BE THUS REMINDED OF HER POSSESSION OF WYNDHAM.BUT GUY SHOWED NO ANNOYANCE THOUGH HE APPEARED A TRIFLE EMBARRASSED ASHE ENTERED. HE QUICKLY RECOVERED HIMSELF HOWEVER AND BEGAN TO EXHIBITA GOOD HUMOUR WHICH ASTONISHED ALDYTH WHO HAD SEEN SCARCELY ANYTHINGOF HER COUSIN SINCE HE QUITTED WYNDHAM. WHEN THEY HAD HAPPENED TO MEETHE HAD MAINTAINED TOWARDS HER A CHILLING COURTESY BUT NOW HERE WASTHE GUY OF OTHER DAYS AS BRIGHT AND KIND AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED TOALIENATE THEM.IVE COME AT THE RIGHT TIME HE SAID APPARENTLY UNAWARE THAT THEREWAS ANYTHING SURPRISING IN HIS APPEARANCE. I SEE YOU WANT A LITTLEHELP. ALDYTH DONT ATTEMPT TO MOVE THAT CHAIR ITS TOO HEAVY FOR YOU.COUSIN LUCY YOU WANT THOSE CURTAINS TAKEN DOWN DONT YOU ILL TACKLETHAT. IF YOU WANT A HANDY MAN TO DO YOUR JOBS HERE I AM.MISS LORRAINE LAUGHED AND LOOKED DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM IN THIS MOOD.IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER LONG TO REGARD GUY WITH DISAPPROVAL. SHE HADTOLD HERSELF IT WAS BUT NATURAL HE SHOULD RESENT ALDYTHS ACQUISITIONOF THE PROPERTY. HIS UNCLE HAD NOT DEALT WELL WITH HIM. SO SHE WELCOMEDWITH JOY THIS MANIFESTATION OF THE OLD FRIENDLINESS AND WAS READY TODO ALL IN HER POWER TO CEMENT THE RECONCILIATION.AND ALDYTH TOO WAS PLEASED. IT WOULD HAVE PAINED HER TO FEEL THATANY ONE REGARDED HER AS AN ENEMY AND IT HAD ESPECIALLY GRIEVED HERTHAT HER OLD PLAYMATE AND COUSIN SHOULD LOOK ON HER WITH COLDNESS ANDSUSPICION. WITH ONE ACCORD THE TWO EXERTED THEMSELVES TO MAKE MUCH OFGUY SO THAT HE FOUND IT EASY TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF ON THE OLD FOOTINGAT WYNDHAM.WE SHALL HAVE TEA ALMOST DIRECTLY SAID MISS LORRAINE. YOU WILL STAYAND TAKE SOME WITH USOF COURSE YOU WILL SAID ALDYTH SCARCE LETTING HIM REPLY. THERE ISNOTHING MORE TO BE DONE HERE. I WAS ONLY TRYING EFFECTS. COME INTO THEGARDEN AND HELP ME GET SOME FLOWERS FOR THE VASES.WITH PLEASURE SAID GUY.IT WAS JUST WHAT HE WANTED TO BE ALONE WITH HER. SO HAVING FOUNDBASKET AND SCISSORS THEY WENT FORTH. THE LATE SUN WAS SENDING ITS LONGRAYS ACROSS THE NEWLYMOWN LAWN AND LIGHTING UP THE GOLDEN HEARTS OFTHE WATERLILIES FLOATING ON THEIR BROAD LEAVES IN THE CENTRE OF THEPOND. BEYOND THE GARDEN VISIBLE THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE TREES AHARVEST FIELD WITH ITS BUSY WORKERS GATHERED ABOUT THE HEAPEDUP CARTMADE A CHARMING PICTURE.AND HOW IS HILDA ASKED ALDYTH LIGHTLY. I HAVE NOT SEEN HER FOR THELAST FEW DAYS.SHE IS VERY WELL I BELIEVE HE SAID BUT WITH SOMETHING SO UNUSUALIN HIS VOICE AND MANNER THAT ALDYTH LOOKED AT HIM CURIOUSLY.WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO THE FARM HE ASKED THE NEXT MINUTE. YOU MUSTPAY ME A VISIT SOME DAY. I HAVE GOT THINGS PRETTY TIDY THERE THOUGHNOT OF COURSE JUST AS YOU WOULD ARRANGE THEM.AH YOU CANNOT EXPECT THE HOUSE TO LOOK QUITE AS IT SHOULD TILL HILDAREIGNS THERE AS MISTRESS SAID ALDYTH WITH A SMILE. BUT THE SMILEDIED AWAY AS GLANCING AT HIM SHE SAW THE STRANGE EFFECT OF HER WORDS.GUYS FACE HAD GROWN CRIMSON HE LOOKED PAINFULLY CONFUSED AND SEEMEDANXIOUS TO AVOID HER GLANCE AS HE STOOD BEATING THE GRASS WITH HISSTICK. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVADE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALDYTHSEYES WERE UPON HIM AND THAT SHE WAITED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF HIS TOOEVIDENT CONFUSION.YOU MUST NOT SPEAK OF THAT ALDYTH HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT HILDAWILL NEVER BE THE MISTRESS OF MY HOME. IN FACTI CAME HERE TO TELLYOUOUR ENGAGEMENT IS AT AN END.OH GUY WAS ALL ALDYTH COULD SAY.YES IT IS SO HE SAID FINDING WORDS MORE READILY NOW. AND ON THEWHOLETHOUGH OF COURSE IT HAS ALL BEEN EXCESSIVELY TRYINGI BELIEVE ITIS FOR THE BEST. WE ARE NOT IN THE LEAST SUITED TO EACH OTHER.ILLUSTRATIONI NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE. THE WORDS SLIPPED FROM ALDYTH ALMOSTUNAWARES. BUT WHAT A PITY SHE ADDED QUICKLY YOU DID NOT FIND THISOUT BEFORE IT WOULD HAVE SPARED HILDA SO MUCH SUFFERING.IT WAS A PITY HE SAID GRAVELY BUT YOU ARE HARDLY THE ONE TOREPROACH ME ALDYTH SINCE IT WAS MAINLY YOUR FAULT.MY FAULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE DEMANDED.YOU KNOW OF WHOM I FIRST THOUGHT HE SAID INSINUATINGLY I HOPED IHAD OVERCOME THAT FEELING. I FANCIED I COULD LOVE HILDA BUT I FOUND ITWAS A MISTAKE.DO NOT SPEAK OF THAT IF YOU PLEASE GUY CRIED ALDYTH HER EYESFLASHING INDIGNATION ON HIM. I WILL NOT HEAR SUCH WORDS. I CANNOTTRUST MYSELF TO SAY WHAT I THINK OF YOUR CONDUCT IT SEEMS TO ME SOUNWORTHY A MAN NOT TO SAY A GENTLEMAN.SHE TURNED FROM HIM IN ANGER AS MISS LORRAINE APPEARED AT THE DRAWINGROOM WINDOW BECKONING TO THEM TO COME IN. ALDYTH HAD TO FLY TO HERROOM TO COOL HER BURNING CHEEKS AND RECOVER SELFPOSSESSION ERE SHETOOK HER PLACE AT THE TEATABLE.TO THINK THAT MEN ARE LIKE THAT SHE SAID TO HERSELF WITH A FEELINGOF GENERAL DISTRUST. AND HILDA I HAVE NOT A DOUBT IS AT THIS MOMENTBREAKING HER HEART FOR HIS SAKE. POOR GIRL HOW I PITY HER AND YET ICAN EASILY SEE THAT THIS SORROW MAY BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.ALDYTH SCARCELY SPOKE TO GUY DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS VISIT BUTMISS LORRAINE CONTINUED TO PET HIM AND HIS SELFCOMPLACENCY SHOWED NOREDUCTION.CHAPTER XXII.A STRICKEN HEROINE AND A SHAMELESS SUITOR.DO LEAVE ME TO MYSELF KITTY IT IS THE ONLY KINDNESS YOU CAN DO MENOW.HILDA BLAND WAS THE SPEAKER AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE TURNED HER HEAD ONTHE PILLOW SO THAT HER SISTER COULD SEE NO MORE OF HER THAN A MASS OFLOOSENED DISORDERED HAIR. KITTY STOOD BY THE BED HOLDING A TRAY ONWHICH WAS SET OUT A MEAL WHICH MIGHT HAVE TEMPTED THE MOST FASTIDIOUSAPPETITE. BUT HILDA WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS LOOK AT THE DAINTY MORSEL OFCHICKEN AND KITTYS EXPRESSION WAS A CURIOUS COMBINATION OF PITY ANDIMPATIENCE.REALLY HILDA I CANNOT SEE ANY SENSE IN STARVING YOURSELF YOU WILLNOT IMPROVE MATTERS BY FALLING ILL.IF I COULD ONLY BE ILL ENOUGH SIGHED HILDA IF I COULD ONLY DIEIF YOU ABSOLUTELY ABSTAIN FROM FOOD YOU WILL DIE SAID KITTY INA MATTEROFFACT TONE BUT I SHOULD CALL IT COWARDLY TO PUT THEEXTINGUISHER ON YOURSELF IN THAT FASHION AND IT WOULD BE CRUEL TOMOTHER.IT IS EASY FOR YOU TO TALK MURMURED HILDA YOU HAVE HAD NO TROUBLEYOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE DECEIVED BY ONE WHOM YOU LOVED ANDTRUSTED. I FEEL THAT ALL HAPPINESS IS OVER FOR ME AND I CAN ONLY DRAGOUT A HOPELESS MISERABLE EXISTENCE. DO YOU WONDER THAT I AM SICK OFLIFEPERHAPS NOT DEAR SAID KITTY GENTLY. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY BADLYTREATED NO DOUBT BUT GUY HAS ACTED SO MEAN A PART THAT IF I WERE YOUI WOULD PLUCK UP HEART AND SHOW THAT I DID NOT THINK HIM WORTH CARINGABOUT. THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN LIFE TO LIVE FOR STILL.I AM WEARY OF THEM ALL SAID HILDA. WE ARE WEARY MY HEART AND II KEEP THINKING OF THOSE LINES. EVERYTHING HAS BECOME HATEFUL TO ME. IONLY WANT TO LIE STILL AND BE LET ALONE. I CAN NEVER BEAR TO WALK OUTIN WOODHAM AGAIN.YOU FEEL SO NOW BUT THE FEELING WILL PASS SAID KITTY. IF ONLY YOUWOULD ROUSE YOURSELF AND FACE YOUR TROUBLE BRAVELY IT WOULD BE SO MUCHBETTER. I KNOW IT IS A TROUBLE BUT MANY ANOTHER GIRL HAS HAD SUCH ADISAPPOINTMENT AND THERE ARE WORSE TROUBLES.IT IS EASY TO SAY SO SAID HILDA BITTERLY BUT YOU KNOW NOTHINGABOUT IT. YOU HAVE NEVER LOVED AS I HAVE.AND I DEVOUTLY HOPE I NEVER SHALL KITTY COULD NOT HELP SAYING BUTIF SUCH TROUBLE CAME TO ME I THINK I SHOULD DO MY BEST TO BEAR ITBRAVELY. IT IS GOD WHO SENDS US TROUBLE AND HE MEANS IT TO WORK OURGOOD.I DONT SEE THAT THERE CAN BE ANY GOOD IN MY TROUBLE SAID HILDAAND I DO NOT BELIEVE GOD SENT IT. IT IS GUY WHO HAS DECEIVED ME ANDMADE ME WRETCHED.NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO US APART FROM THE WILL OF GOD SAID KITTY ANDHE WILL HELP US TO BEAR OUR SORROWS IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM. WHENTROUBLE COMES TO ME AS I KNOW IT MUST SOME DAY I HOPE I MAY BE ABLETO RESIGN MYSELF TO HIS WILL AND LEARN THE LESSON HE MEANS IT TO TEACHME.IT WAS RARELY KITTY SPOKE THUS SERIOUSLY AND HER DOING SO SHOWED HOWANXIOUS SHE WAS TO HELP HER SISTER. NO ONE GAVE KITTY CREDIT FOR MUCHTHOUGHTFULNESS BUT AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY A LIVELY GIRL THE HIDDENCURRENTS OF HER LIFE WERE DEEPER THAN HER FRIENDS SUPPOSED. IT WAS NOTBY CHANCE THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS CHEERFUL GOODTEMPERED AND UNSELFISH.AT THE ROOT OF HER CHARACTER LAY A SIMPLE BUT STRONG RELIGIOUS FAITHAND SHE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THE RESOLVE MADE AT THE TIME OF HERFATHERS DEATH THAT SHE WOULD BE GOOD AND DO ALL IN HER POWER TOCHEER AND HELP HER MOTHER.BUT HILDA WAS NOT IN A MOOD TO PROFIT BY HER SISTERS WORDS.I DARE SAY YOU THINK SO SHE SAID IMPATIENTLY BUT WAIT TILL YOURTURN COMESTHOUGH I AM SURE I HOPE YOU MAY NEVER KNOW SUCH TROUBLE ASMINE. DO TAKE THAT TRAY AWAY KITTY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EAT.SO KITTY WENT AWAY FEELING THAT SHE HAD WASTED WORDS AND THATPROBABLY THE BEST THING FOR HILDA AT PRESENT WAS TO BE LEFT ALONE.BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS REFLECTION SCARCE HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSEDWHEN SHE AGAIN APPEARED IN HER SISTERS ROOM.ALDYTH IS DOWN STAIRS SHE SAID. SHE IS SO SORRY HILDA SHE FEELSAS WE ALL DO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HEROH NO CRIED HILDA EXCITEDLY. THE LAST PERSON I SHOULD WISH TO SEEI DO NOT SAY SHE IS TO BLAME BUT IT IS HER HAVING WYNDHAM WHICH HASCAUSED ALL MY MISERY.REALLY EXCLAIMED KITTY FINDING HER SISTER INCOMPREHENSIBLE. ISHOULD RATHER THINK IT WAS GUY BEING WHAT HE IS. IT SEEMS TO ME WELLTHAT YOU HAVE FOUND OUT IN TIME THAT HE IS ONE PERSON IN PROSPERITYAND ANOTHER IN ADVERSITY.WITH THAT KITTY LEFT HER SISTER AND DESCENDED TO THE DRAWING ROOMWHERE ALDYTH SAT TALKING WITH MRS. BLAND. THE MOTHERS KINDLY FACE WOREA LOOK OF CARE BUT SHE SPOKE CHEERFULLY.POOR CHILD SHE SAID. SHE FEELS IT SORELY NOW BUT I THANKFUL IT ISNO WORSE. IF SHE HAD MARRIED HIM UNDER THE IMPRESSION HE WAS A HEROAND THEN FOUND OUT WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THAT HE WAS OF COMMON CLAYIT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAR GREATER MISFORTUNE. I FEAR HER LOVE WOULD NOTHAVE BORNE THAT STRAIN AND IT IS A TERRIBLE THING FOR A WOMAN TO FINDHERSELF BOUND TO A MAN WHOM SHE CAN NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT.I ALWAYS FELT THEY WERE NOT SUITED TO EACH OTHER. I FANCY GUY DID NOTKNOW HIS OWN MIND IT WAS A CAPRICE WHICH OPPOSITION STRENGTHENED. ITHINK FEW MEN ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING RIGHT CHOICE OF A WIFE BEFORE THEYARE TWENTYFIVE. BUT IT IS HARD THAT POOR HILDA SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFERFOR HIS LACK OF DISCRETION.SHE WILL NOT SEE YOU ALDYTH KITTY SAID THERE IS NO ROUSING HERANYHOW.I AM AFRAID SHE FINDS A KIND OF ROMANTIC SATISFACTION IN CHERISHINGAND EVEN EXAGGERATING HER UNHAPPINESS SAID MRS. BLAND. THAT ISTHE WAY WITH YOU YOUNG THINGS WHEN TROUBLE COMES TO YOU YOU LIKE TOTHINK THAT NOTHING CAN EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN YOU DO NOT WANT TO BECOMFORTED.NOW MOTHER YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME IN TROUBLE SAID KITTY LIGHTLYYOU DO NOT KNOW HOW WISE I SHOULD BE.NO INDEED CHILD REPLIED MRS. BLAND WITH A TENDER GLANCE AT HERELDEST GIRL. GOD GRANT I NEVER MAYTHE BEST THING FOR HILDA WOULD BE A CHANGE SHE ADDED TURNING TOALDYTH. I HAD A LETTER FROM MY COUSIN MRS. LANCASTER A FORTNIGHTAGO ASKING ME TO LET MY GIRLS GO WITH HER AND HER DAUGHTER FOR A TOURIN BRITTANY. HILDA DID NOT CARE ABOUT IT SO WE REFUSED THE INVITATIONBUT I THINK PERHAPS SHE MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GO NOW AND AS MY COUSINDOES NOT START TILL NEXT WEEK I HAVE WRITTEN TO ASK IF SHE IS STILLWILLING TO TAKE THE GIRLS.OH THAT WOULD SURELY BE GOOD FOR HILDA SAID ALDYTH. SHE HAS NEVERBEEN ABROAD. OH I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE IT.I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF HILDA POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GO SAID KITTY.BUT HER SISTER PROVED IN THIS INSTANCE MORE TRACTABLE THAN KITTYEXPECTED. LIFE WAS STRONG IN HER AFTER ALL AND SINCE IT BECAME EVERYDAY MORE CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO DIE ABSENCE FROM WOODHAMSEEMED THE ONLY CONDITION UNDER WHICH LIFE COULD BE ENDURED. HILDASPRIDE WAS PERHAPS AS DEEPLY WOUNDED AS HER AFFECTIONS. SHE DREADEDTO MEET THE OBSERVANT PERHAPS PITYING GLANCES OF HER ACQUAINTANCESSHE HATED THE THOUGHT OF THE TALK CONCERNING HER BROKEN ENGAGEMENT THATMUST BE GOING ON IN WOODHAM.BUT EACH WOUND WAS DEEP AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS NONE THE LESSKEEN THAT SHE HAD PERHAPS BEEN MORE IN LOVE WITH LOVE THAN WITH GUYLORRAINE. SHE HAD CHERISHED HER LOVE SHE HAD BROODED OVER IT SHE HADFED IT WITH ALL FOOD OF THE IMAGINATION WHICH SHE COULD DRAW FROM POETOR ROMANCE WRITER. AND THE ROMANTIC LOVE THUS FOSTERED WAS NOT THESTRONG CLEARSIGHTED LOVE WHICH DISCERNS AND COMPREHENDS EVERY FACTRELATING TO THE ONE BELOVED. THE TRUE GUY HILDA HAD NEVER KNOWN. THEGREATER ON THIS ACCOUNT WAS THE PAIN SHE SUFFERED WHEN HER LOVER BEGANTO TREAT HER WITH CARELESSNESS AND INDIFFERENCE THE MORE CRUSHING THEBLOW DEALT BY THE COOLLYWRITTEN LETTER IN WHICH HE INFORMED HER THATHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD MISTAKEN HIS FEELINGS WHEN HE THOUGHTTHAT HE LOVED HER BUT WAS NOW CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE NOT IN THELEAST SUITED TO EACH OTHER.AS SHE HAD BROODED OVER HER LOVE HILDA NOW BROODED OVER HER SORROWNURSING IT MAGNIFYING IT LETTING HER FANCY PLAY OVER IT ANDDESIRING NOT COMFORT BUT DUE APPRECIATION OF THE GREATNESS OF HERMISERY.ALDYTH WAS GLAD WHEN SHE KNEW THAT KITTY AND HILDA HAD STARTED TO JOINTHE LANCASTERS IN LONDON. SHE BELIEVED THAT THE THOROUGH CHANGE ANDDIVERSION AFFORDED BY A FOREIGN TOUR MUST HELP HILDA TO RECOVER HERSPIRITS.ALDYTH FELT DEEPLY FOR HILDA WHOSE STATE OF MIND SHE UNDERSTOODPERHAPS BETTER THAN KITTY DID FOR SHE HAD SEEN ALL ALONG HOWCOMPLETELY HILDA HAD DECEIVED HERSELF WITH REGARD TO THE CHARACTER OFGUY LORRAINE. IT ANNOYED ALDYTH TO SEE HOW UTTERLY GUY IGNORED THATHE HAD ANYTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF IN HIS TREATMENT OF HILDA BLAND. HERATHER SEEMED TO PRIDE HIMSELF ON THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD ACTED. ITCOMMENDED ITSELF TO HIS SENSE OF PRUDENCE AND HE WAS NOT THE ONLYPERSON AT WOODHAM WHO REGARDED HIS ACTION THUS FAVOURABLY NOR WASCLARA DAWTREY THE ONLY ONE WHO DERIVED SATISFACTION FROM THE THOUGHTOF HILDA BLANDS MORTIFICATION. BUT ALDYTH COULD ONLY EXPLAIN THEIRREPROACHABLE AIR WITH WHICH GUY BORE HIMSELF BY THE ASSUMPTION THATHE WAS SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF CERTAIN THOUGHTS ANDFEELINGS WHICH TO HER APPEARED NATURAL AND ESSENTIAL. SHE WAS DESTINEDTO RECEIVE FURTHER PROOF OF THIS THEORY ERE LONG.ALDYTH COMFORTED HERSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT IT WAS PROBABLYA HAPPY THING FOR HILDA THAT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD COME TO AN END.HER SENSITIVE EMOTIONAL NATURE MUST HAVE SUFFERED CONSTANT PAININ DAILY ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHOSE IDEAS WERE SO MATTEROFFACTAND WHOSE PERCEPTIONS WERE OBTUSE TO ALL THAT DID NOT IMMEDIATELYCONCERN HIMSELF. ALDYTHS OWN FEELINGS TOWARDS HER COUSIN AT THISTIME WERE STRANGELY MINGLED. IN HER DISGUST AT HIS CONDUCT TOWARDSHILDA SHE HAD SHRUNK FROM HIM AND BUT FOR MISS LORRAINES EFFORTSAND GUYS PERSISTENCE IN TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HER THERECONCILIATION JUST EFFECTED MIGHT HAVE BEEN RUPTURED AS SOON AS MADE.BUT THERE WAS A MOTIVE WHICH URGED ALDYTH TO AVOID ANOTHER ESTRANGEMENTFROM HER COUSIN. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR THE FACTSHE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT HER GAIN HAD BEEN GUYS LOSS. IT WAS NOTA GAIN THAT HAD BROUGHT HER INCREASED SATISFACTION BUT SHE KNEW THATHIS LOSS HAD CAUSED GUY MUCH CHAGRIN AND THAT MANY PERSONS PITIED HIMON ACCOUNT OF IT. SHE WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THIS WHENEVER SHE SAWHIM AND IT MADE HER TOLERANT OF HIS SOCIETY AND ANXIOUS TO DO ALL INHER POWER TO MAKE AMENDS TO HIM FOR HIS LOSS.GUY UNDERSTOOD HIS COUSIN SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO DIVINE THAT THIS WOULDBE HER FEELING BUT WHILST ALDYTH WAS RACKING HER BRAIN TO DEVISEDELICATE AND PRACTICABLE MODES OF MAKING UP TO HIM IN SOME DEGREE FORWHAT HE HAD LOST HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A MEANS OF RESTITUTIONWHICH NEVER CROSSED HER MIND. PEOPLE SEEING THE COUSINS TOGETHER AGAINAND APPARENTLY ON THE OLD TERMS WERE QUICK TO SAY THAT IT WAS PLAINWHY HILDA BLAND HAD BEEN JILTED. GUY DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT WHATPEOPLE MIGHT SAY BUT TO ALDYTH THE IDEA WAS SO IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHENEVER CONCEIVED THAT OTHERS MIGHT ENTERTAIN IT.SHE PERSUADED GUY TO ACCEPT AS A GIFT FROM HER THE HORSE WHICH HEHAD BEEN WONT TO RIDE WHEN HE LIVED AT WYNDHAM SHE CONSULTED HIM ONVARIOUS MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE ESTATE AND ALLOWED HIM TO HELP HERBUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE TREATED HIM WITH THE FRANKNESS AND OCCASIONALSEVERITY OF AN ELDER SISTER THOUGH IN TRUTH SHE WAS HIS JUNIOR. ANDTHERE WAS NOTHING IN HER MANNER THAT COULD FLATTER HIS VANITY ORENCOURAGE THE HOPE HE WAS CHERISHING.BUT THE SELFESTEEM OF SOME PERSONS REQUIRES LITTLE SUPPORT AND THEEVENT WHICH ONE WILL REGARD AS IMPOSSIBLE WILL STRIKE ANOTHER AS HIGHLYPROBABLE. GUY HAD NO IDEA THAT THE PURPOSE HE HAD FORMED INVOLVED ANASTOUNDING SURPRISE FOR ALDYTH AND PERHAPS SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTERPREPARED FOR IT THAN SHE WAS.ONE WARM AFTERNOON ALDYTH WAS IN THE LIBRARY AT WYNDHAM WORRYINGHERSELF OVER SOME BUSINESS DETAILS SUBMITTED TO HER BY HER BAILIFFWHICH SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. HER HEAD ACHED THE HEAT WASSTUPEFYING AND HER PERPLEXITY ONLY INCREASED THE LONGER SHE STUDIEDTHE ACCOUNT. IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT SHE HEARD GUYS STEP INTHE HALL AND CALLED HIM TO HER. THERE WAS A WELCOME IN HER GLANCE ERESHE SAID BRIGHTLYOH I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU. DO COME AND TELL ME WHAT THIS MAN MEANS METO UNDERSTAND BY THIS COMPLICATED DOCUMENT.WILLINGLY IF I CAN SAID GUY AS HE DREW A CHAIR TO HER SIDE. THEMATTER WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO HIM. HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK AFTERHIS UNCLES BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE HAD EXPLAINEDEVERYTHING ALDYTH FOUND PUZZLING AND ALSO GIVEN HER A LITTLE ADVICEWITH REGARD TO THE BUSINESS UNDER CONSIDERATION.TOMLINSON IS A GOOD FELLOW HE SAID BUT YOU MUST NOT LET HIM HAVEEVERYTHING HIS OWN WAY. AN AGENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TOO MUCH POWER.BUT HOW CAN I HELP IT ASKED ALDYTH. HE UNDERSTANDS THESE THINGSAND I DO NOT.THATS IT SAID GUY SEIZING HIS OPPORTUNITY. YOU NEED SOME ONE BYYOUR SIDE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE AN ESTATE. DEAR ALDYTH I WISH YOUWOULD LET ME HELP YOU.YOU DO HELP ME GUY SHE SAID PUZZLED BY HIS MANNER BUT YET FARFROM SEEING HIS DRIFT YOU ARE VERY GOOD TO HELP ME AS YOU DO.AH BUT I COULD BE SO MUCH MORE TO YOU IF YOU WOULD LET ME HE SAIDAND NOW HIS VOICE TOOK A TENDER TONE WHICH ROUSED HER TO A SENSE OFDANGER IF ONLY YOU WOULD LET SHARE ALL YOUR BURDENS AND CARES IF YOUWOULD LET THINGS BE AS UNCLE ALWAYS MEANT THEM TO BE.CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE GUY CERTAINLY EXPRESSEDHIMSELF WITH MUCH CLEVERNESS AND SHOWED WHAT IMAGINATIVE LANGUAGE EVENCOMMONPLACE MINDS CAN COMMAND UNDER SUFFICIENT STIMULUS. BUT THE EFFECTOF HIS WORDS WAS NOT SUCH AS HE DESIRED.ALDYTH STARTED UP A FLUSH OF ANGER ON HER CHEEK. GUY I CANNOT THINKWHAT YOU MEAN BY SPEAKING IN SUCH A WAYOH YES YOU MUST KNOW HE SAID. I TOLD YOU BEFORE THAT I LOVED YOU.HE PAUSED CHECKED BY THE SCORN HE READ IN HER GLANCE.I SHOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR NOT SAYING IT AGAINSHE REPLIED IN COLD CLEAR TONES WHICH HAD AN EDGE OF CONTEMPT.IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY I MADE YOU AWARE THEN HOW I REGARDED YOURPROFESSIONS AND YOU CANNOT SURELY IMAGINE THAT AFTER ALL THAT HASHAPPENED AND HILDA BLAND BEING MY FRIEND I SHOULD REGARD THEMOTHERWISE NOW ESPECIALLY ASEXCUSE ME GUY THE MOTIVE IS SO EVIDENT.GUY LOOKED DOWN AND HIS FACE FLUSHED BUT HE SAID DOGGEDLYYOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU LIKE BUT I THINK YOU OWE SOMETHING TO ME. YOUFORGET THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO ME.NO I DO NOT FORGET IT SAID ALDYTH WARMLY I CANNOT FORGET IT IAM OPPRESSED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS SO. I WOULD SET MATTERS RIGHTBETWEEN US AT ONCE IF I KNEW HOW.THERE IS BUT ONE WAY HE SAID.THEN IT IS A WAY I SHALL NEVER TAKE SHE SAID HER EYES FLASHING ONHIM. I WOULD NOT SET A WRONG RIGHT BY COMMITTING A GREATER WRONG. IWOULD GIVE YOU WYNDHAM TOMORROW RATHER THAN DO THAT.BUT THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID. I COULD NOT IN HONOUR ACCEPTSUCH A GIFT FROM YOU.I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT CONSIDERATIONS OF HONOUR WOULD HAVE TROUBLEDYOU GUY SAID ALDYTH UNABLE TO RESIST THE RETORT.BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF IT WHEN IT HAD PASSED HER LIPS AND FEELINGTHAT THERE WAS DANGER IN HER GROWING EXCITEMENT SHE TURNED TO QUITTHE ROOM. ERE SHE COULD REACH THE DOOR IT WAS OPENED BY A SERVANTEVIDENTLY LOOKING FOR HER. ON THE SALVER IN HIS HAND LAY A TELEGRAM.FOR YOU MISS LORRAINE HE SAID. A MAN HAS RIDDEN FROM WOODHAM WITHIT.ALDYTH PASSED INTO THE HALL AS SHE TORE THE ENVELOPE OPEN. THE TELEGRAMWAS FROM EASTBOURNE AND THE SENDER WAS GLADYS. WE ARE IN DREADFULTROUBLE COME TO US WAS ALL IT SAID.CHAPTER XXIII.LOSSES AND GAINS.IT WAS SHOCKING AND TERRIBLE NEWS MRS. STANTON HAD RECEIVED BY TELEGRAMFROM MELBOURNE EARLIER IN THAT DAY. THE FIRM OF STANTON BROS. HAD COMETO UTTER BANKRUPTCY SUCH AS REDUCED TO POVERTY EVERY ONE CONNECTEDWITH THE FIRM AND BROUGHT UNLOOKEDFOR DESTITUTION UPON MANY ANINNOCENT SUFFERER. BUT THIS WAS NOT THE WHOLE OF THE CALAMITY.THE HEALTHGIVING INFLUENCES OF THE VOYAGE HAD NOT SO INVIGORATED MR.STANTON THAT HE COULD SUSTAIN THE SHOCK OF MISFORTUNE THAT AWAITED HIMON HIS ARRIVAL AT MELBOURNE. HE WENT TO HIS OFFICE ALMOST IMMEDIATELYON LANDING AND THERE LEARNED FROM HIS BROTHER THE CRITICAL STATE OFAFFAIRS. HE HAD LISTENED CALMLY HAD MADE FULL INQUIRIES AND SATISFIEDHIMSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID HOPELESS IRRETRIEVABLEFAILURE. THEN WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MARKED SIGNS OF AGITATION HE HADRETURNED TO HIS HOTEL BUT ON THE THRESHOLD HIS STEP FALTERED ASTRANGE SPASM PASSED OVER HIS FACE AND HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND.IT WAS THE LAST FATAL STROKE OF PARALYSIS. WITHIN THREE HOURS HE WASDEAD.BUT AS YET HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN KNEW NO PARTICULARS ONLY THE BARECRUEL FACTS CONVEYED WITH CURT EMPHASIS BY THE TELEGRAM. AS THEY BEGANTO RECOVER FROM THE FIRST STUNNING EFFECT OF THE BLOW THEIR ONE WISHWAS FOR ALDYTHS PRESENCE. THE TROUBLE WOULD BE LESS BEWILDERING LESSOVERWHELMING IF SHE WERE THERE. COMFORT OF SOME KIND ALDYTH WOULDSURELY BRING.SEND FOR ALDYTH MRS. STANTON WHISPERED TO GLADYS IN ONE OF THEINTERVALS BETWEEN HER FITS OF HYSTERICAL WEEPING AND GLADYS LOST NOTIME IN OBEYING.THE GIRLS WERE VERY ANXIOUS FOR THE COMING OF THEIR SISTER MID MADEMANY CALCULATIONS AS TO HOW SOON SHE COULD ARRIVE WITHOUT ATTAININGCERTAINTY THAT SHE COULD GET TO EASTBOURNE THAT DAY.BUT THE LAST TRAIN JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT BROUGHT ALDYTH.GLADYS WATCHING AT THE WINDOW OF THEIR SITTING ROOM SAW THE CABDRIVE UP TO THE DOOR AND HURRIED DOWN TO MEET HER. MRS. STANTON HADRETIRED TO REST AND WORN OUT WITH WEEPING WAS ALREADY ASLEEP NELLYWAS SITTING BESIDE HER SO GLADYS ALONE WELCOMED ALDYTH. GLADYS WITHPALE FACE PINK EYELIDS AND A WEARY ANXIOUS EXPRESSION LOOKED WHOLLYDIFFERENT FROM THE BRIGHT RADIANT GIRL FROM WHOM ALDYTH HAD PARTED AFEW WEEKS EARLIER. SORROW SEEMS THE MORE PATHETIC WHEN ITS SHADOW FALLSON ONE SO YOUNG AND GAY.OH ALDYTH I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME SHE SAID CLASPING HER SISTER INHER ARMS. THINGS WILL SEEM BETTER NOW. BUT IS IT NOT DREADFULYOU FORGET I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE IS SAID ALDYTH WHO HADBEEN FULL OF WONDER CONCERNING IT AS SHE JOURNEYED TO EASTBOURNE.POOR PAPA IS DEAD SAID GLADYS AND WE ARE BEGGARS. THE TWO FACTSWERE APPARENTLY OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO GLADYS BUT ALDYTH ONLY HEEDEDTHE FORMER.SHE WAS PAINFULLY STARTLED SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THEFAILING APPEARANCE OF THE WORN NERVOUS MAN BUT SHE WAS NOT PREPAREDTO HEAR SO SOON OF HIS DECEASE AND IT STRUCK HER AS VERY SAD THAT HESHOULD DIE FAR AWAY FROM HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN.OH GLADYS SHE SAID. I AM GRIEVED FOR YOU. POOR MAMMA WHAT WILLSHE DO HOW WAS ITPARALYSIS THE TELEGRAM SAYS REPLIED GLADYS BUT WE KNOW HARDLYANYTHING. THAT WAS WHAT MAMMA HAD FEARED.

HOW TERRIBLE THE NEWS SEEMS COMINGIN THESE FEW COLD WORDS WHAT A SHOCK FOR MAMMA HOW DID SHE BEAR ITSHE ALMOST FAINTED AND THEN SHE WENT INTO HYSTERICS SAID GLADYSWITH UNCONSCIOUS DRYNESS BUT SHE IS QUIETER NOW. MAMMA SAYS THATTHINGS HAVE BEEN GOING WRONG IN THE BUSINESS FOR SOME TIME AND THATPAPA SAID THAT IF IT CAME TO BANKRUPTCY WE MUST LOSE EVERYTHING. SHESAYS SHE BELIEVES WE HAVE NOT A PENNY.DO NOT LET THAT TROUBLE YOU SAID ALDYTH KINDLY YOUR GREATESTLOSS CAN NEVER BE MADE UP TO YOU BUT AS FAR AS THE MONEY GOES I HAVEENOUGH FOR US ALL. OH I AM GLAD NOW THAT UNCLE MADE ME RICH.AND AT THAT MOMENT ALDYTH EXPERIENCED THE UTMOST SATISFACTION HERFORTUNE HAD BROUGHT HER.I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD BEFORE THIS SAIDGLADYS AND YOU WONT WANT A LOT OF POOR RELATIVES HANGING ON YOU.I SHOULD BE MUCH POORER IF I HAD NOT THE RELATIVES SAID ALDYTH.WHERE IS NELLYSHE IS WITH MAMMA BUT I WILL GO AND RELIEVE HER NOW. YOU ARE TO SHAREHER ROOM. SHE HAS BEEN LONGING FOR YOU TO COME.ALREADY GLADYSS LOOK HAD BRIGHTENED AND SHE WALKED AWAY WITH HERUSUAL QUICK LIGHT STEP. SHE WAS NOT ONE TO DROOP LONG UNDER TROUBLE.LIKE A BENT FLOWER SHE COULD LIFT HER HEAD AT THE FIRST BREAK IN THESTORM.IN A FEW MINUTES NELLY WAS IN HER SISTERS ARMS. THE CHILDS FACELOOKED WORN AND AGED THE EYES WERE UNNATURALLY BRIGHT BUT SHOWED NOSIGNS OF WEEPING. AT ALDYTHS TENDER GREETING HOWEVER HER COMPOSUREGAVE WAY. SHE BROKE INTO HEAVY SOBS AS SHE CLUNG TO HER SISTER.OH ALDYTH IS IT NOT DREADFUL POOR PAPAYES DEAR IT IS VERY SAD ALDYTH SAID.I NEVER THOUGHTI NEVER EXPECTED SUCH A THING SOBBED NELLY. OFCOURSE I KNEW HE WAS NOT WELL BUT HE HAD BEEN OUT OF SORTS A LONGTIME AND MAMMA SAID THE VOYAGE WOULD SET HIM UP. IT IS SO SAD THAT HESHOULD DIE AWAY FROM US ALL. ALDYTH HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TOGO BACK ALONE.ALDYTH DID NOT AT ONCE REPLY.PERHAPS NOT SHE SAID PRESENTLY BUT NELLY IT IS VAIN TO THINK OFTHAT NOW.THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO DREADFUL CRIED NELLY. ALDYTH I FEEL NOWTHAT I NEVER LOVED PAPA AS I SHOULD. HE WAS JUST PAPA WHO FOUND THEMONEY AND SAW WE HAD EVERYTHING WE WANTED. I TOOK IT ALL AS A RIGHTAND NEVER WAS A BIT GRATEFUL. DO YOU KNOW ONE SATURDAY AFTER YOU HADGONE TO WOODHAM HE CAME IN VERY TIRED WHEN MAMMA AND GLADYS WERE OUTAND I FETCHED HIS SLIPPERS AND GOT SOME TEA FOR HIM JUST AS YOU USEDTO DO. HE SEEMED SO SURPRISED AND PLEASED. HE SAID WHY NELLY YOUARE GETTING AS THOUGHTFUL AS ALDYTH. I FELT REPROACHED AS HE SAID ITTHOUGH HE DID NOT MEAN IT AS A REPROACH.BUT YOU ARE THANKFUL NOW ARE YOU NOT DEAR THAT YOU DID HIM THATLITTLE SERVICE ALDYTH SAID.OH BUT IT WAS ONLY THAT ONCE REPLIED NELLY WITH A FRESH BURSTOF WEEPING. HE WENT AWAY SO SOON AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOT ANOTHEROPPORTUNITY. BUT I MIGHT HAVE SERVED HIM OFTEN AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE.HE IS GONE FROM MEMY FATHERAND I DID NOT LOVE AND VALUE HIM WHILST IHAD HIMALDYTH DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CHECK HER TEARS. SHE FELT THAT WORDS COULDNOT SOOTHE SUCH GRIEF AS THIS. THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD FAILED IN HERDUTY TOWARDS HER FATHER WOULD LONG STING POOR NELLYS HEART BUT THEPAIN MIGHT BE SALUTARY FROM IT MIGHT SPRING THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OFLOVE AND CARE FOR OTHERS.AFTER A PAUSE ALDYTH SAIDNELLY I AM REMINDED OF SOME WORDS I READ A WHILE AGO. I THINK THEYWERE RICHTERS AND TO THIS EFFECT THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WREATH WECAN LAY ON THE GRAVE OF OUR DEAD IS WOVEN OF GOOD DEEDS DONE TO OTHERS.WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT NOW. WE CANNOT UNDO THE PAST WE CANNOT RECALLTHE LOST OPPORTUNITY OR THE CARELESS WORD BUT WE CAN ENDEAVOUR TO SHOWALL THE LOVE AND KINDNESS IN OUR POWER TO THOSE WHO STILL REMAIN WITHUS.I WILL TRY TO BE GOOD FALTERED NELLY BUT I HAVE SUCH A TEMPER ANDMAMMA AND GLADYS IRRITATE ME SO.IT IS NEVER EASY TO CONQUER ONESELF SAID ALDYTH BUT THE VICTORY ISWORTH ALL THE PAINS. AND WE HAVE NOT TO FIGHT ALONE. THERE IS ONE WHOWILL HELP US IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM.THEY WENT TO THEIR ROOM AND ALDYTH HELPED NELLY WHO WAS QUITE WORNOUT WITH THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE DAY TO UNDRESS AND SAW HER INTO BEDWHERE SHE FELL ASLEEP ALMOST AS SOON AS HER HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW.ALDYTH TOO WAS TIRED BUT AFTER SHE HAD EXTINGUISHED THE LIGHT SHEKNELT LONG IN THE DARKNESS ERE SHE LAY DOWN TO REST.WHEN ALDYTH WOKE THE NEXT MORNING SHE FELT AS IF WOODHAM WYNDHAM THEEVENTS OF YESTERDAY WERE ALL REMOVED TO A GREAT DISTANCE. THE THINGSWHICH A FEW HOURS BEFORE HAD BEEN OF INTEREST TO HER NOW SEEMED OF NOIMPORTANCE. HER MIND WAS FILLED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HER MOTHERS GREATSORROW AND HOW SHE MIGHT BEST HELP AND COMFORT HER.AS SOON AS SHE KNEW THAT HER MOTHER WAS AWAKE SHE WENT TO HER ROOMAND WAS RECEIVED WITH A DEMONSTRATIVE AFFECTION FOR WHICH SHE WASHARDLY PREPARED.THANK GOD YOU ARE COME DARLING SAID MRS. STANTON EMBRACING HER. IWANT YOU NOW MY ELDEST DAUGHTER I HAVE NO ONE TO LEAN ON BUT YOU. MYHUSBAND MY HOME EVERYTHING IS TAKEN FROM ME.AND SHE SANK BACK ON HER PILLOW SOBBING.MOTHER DARLING CRIED ALDYTH BENDING OVER HER WITH A TENDERNESSALMOST MATERNAL IN HER MANNERIT WAS AS IF THE MOTHER AND CHILD HADCHANGED PLACES.

STANTON YOU ARE SOGOOD. THEN WITH A FRESH FLOW OF TEARSBUT IT IS DREADFUL TO LOSE MYHUSBAND SOWITHOUT A WORD AND I CANNOT EVEN LOOK UPON HIS LIFELESSFORM. IT IS SO HARD.ALDYTH COULD NOT SPEAK IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPINGHERSELF BUT SHE KISSED HER MOTHER AND LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST HERS ANDTHE MUTE CARESSES WERE MORE SOOTHING THAN WORDS.LATER IN THE DAY CECIL ARRIVED FROM LONDON PREPARED TO STAY OVERSUNDAY WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS. HE APPEARED SHOCKED BY THE NEWSBUT IT WAS THE PECUNIARY LOSS THAT MOST AFFECTED HIS SPIRITS AS ALDYTHCOULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE. IT TOUCHED HER TO THINK HOW SLIGHT A HOLDROBERT STANTON HAD HAD ON THE HEARTS OF HIS CHILDREN. WITH WHOM DIDTHE FAULT LIE HAD HE LIVED TOO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS TO FIND TIME FORTHE CULTURE OF FAMILY AFFECTIONS OR DID THE INFIRMITY OF HIS EXTREMESHYNESS AND RESERVE RAISE A BARRIER EVEN BETWEEN HIM AND HIS CHILDRENALDYTH WAS INCLINED TO EXPLAIN IT BY THE LATTER SUPPOSITION FOR THELITTLE SHE HAD SEEN OF HER STEPFATHER LED HER TO CREDIT HIM WITH A GOODHEART KEENLY RESPONSIVE TO KINDNESS BUT INCAPABLE FROM PHYSICALHINDRANCES OF GIVING READY EXPRESSION TO FEELING.CECILS MIND WAS IN A STATE OF INDIGNANT RESISTANCE TO THE CALAMITYTHAT HAD OVERTAKEN THEM. HE WAS GLAD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF FREELY WHEN HEGOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TO ALDYTH ALONE.IT IS ALL MY UNCLES FAULT I KNOW HE SAID NOW YOU SEE WHEN WEGET PARTICULARS IF IT DOES NOT COME OUT THAT THE FAILURE IS ENTIRELYOWING TO SOME RASH SPECULATION MY UNCLE HAS PLUNGED INTO. MY FATHER LETHIM HAVE THINGS TOO MUCH HIS OWN WAY. IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE. IT IS ALLVERY WELL TO TALK ABOUT AFFLICTION BUT THIS IS MY UNCLES DOING AND IMEAN TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT I THINK OF HIS CONDUCT.WILL THAT BE OF ANY GOOD ASKED ALDYTH GENTLY. I SUPPOSE HE AND HISFAMILY ARE ALSO REDUCED TO POVERTY. HE MUST DEPLORE HIS ACTION NOW ASMUCH AS YOU DO.WHETHER IT IS OF ANY GOOD OR NOT I MEAN TO DO IT FOR MY OWNSATISFACTION REPLIED CECIL. IT IS NO JOKE TO HAVE THE WHOLE OF YOURINCOME SWEPT AWAY. WHAT AM I TO DO WHAT IS TO BECOME OF MAMMA AND THEGIRLSOH DO NOT LET THAT TROUBLE YOU SAID ALDYTH.

ICONSIDER THAT MAMMA SHARES ALL MY POSSESSIONS.IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID CECIL LOOKING RELIEVED AND YET ALITTLE UNEASY. YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS. I DONT BELIEVE GLADYS WOULD BESO READY TO LET OTHERS SPEND HER MONEY.DONT SAY THATIT IS RATHER MEAN FOR YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY TELL WHATGLADYS WOULD DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I CANNOT SEE THAT THEREIS ANY GENEROSITY IN GIVING AWAY WHAT YOU WILL NEVER MISS. I COULD NOTPOSSIBLY SPEND ON MYSELF THE INCOME WHICH IS NOW MINE. I DONT KNOWWHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IF THIS HAD NOT HAPPENED FOR I AM NOT A FINELADY. I HAVE AN INBRED HORROR OF EXTRAVAGANCE.CECIL LAUGHED.YOU ARE NOT LIKE GLADYS THEN.

WHEN I GET A BROKEN ARM ORA SPRAINED ANKLE I SHALL BE HAPPY FOR YOU TO EXERCISE YOUR SURGICALSKILL UPON IT.ALDYTH REMAINED WITH HER MOTHER AND SISTERS FOR A WEEK AT EASTBOURNEKEEPING ALMOST IN SECLUSION. YET FOR HER IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR THEREWERE MANY ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE LETTERS TO BE WRITTEN FRIENDS TO BESEEN AND EVERY TASK FROM WHICH HER MOTHER AND GLADYS SHRANK DEVOLVEDUPON HER.MRS. STANTON GRADUALLY RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF ILLTIDINGS ANDAFTER A FEW DAYS BEGAN TO MOVE LESS LANGUIDLY AND TO SHOW SOME FAINTINTEREST IN THE FUTURE THAT AWAITED HER.TO THINK THAT I SHOULD LIVE AT WYNDHAM AFTER ALL SHE SAID TO ALDYTH.YOUR FATHER USED TO TALK OF IT AT ONE TIME WHEN HE HOPED HIS UNCLEWOULD FORGIVE US BUT THAT NEVER CAME TO PASS. IT IS STRANGE THAT ISHOULD GO THERE NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED.BUT IT IS RATHER A DREARY OLD PLACE IS IT NOTI HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND IT SO SAID ALDYTH. I THINK IT IS VERYPRETTY IN THE SUMMER.ALDYTH WAS GLAD THAT HER PREPARATIONS FOR HER MOTHERS VISIT TO WYNDHAMWERE ABOUT FINISHED ERE SHE WAS SUMMONED AWAY.SHE WROTE TO INFORM HER AUNT OF THE TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT BE EXPECTEDAND TO BEG HER TO BE AT WYNDHAM TO WELCOME THEM.UNFORTUNATELY THE SEPTEMBER EVENING ON WHICH ALDYTH WITH HER MOTHER ANDGLADYS ARRIVED AT WOODBURN WAS VERY WET AND UNDER DRIVING RAIN AND ALEADEN SKY THE HIGH STREET AND THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO WYNDHAM LOOKEDFAR FROM INTERESTING. MRS. STANTONS COUNTENANCE ITS PALE DELICATEBEAUTY STRIKINGLY SET OFF BY THE FOLDS OF CRAPE WHICH FRAMED IT WOREA MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION AS SHE GLANCED FROM THE CARRIAGE AT THE GLOOMYPROSPECT.I ALWAYS SAID I COULD NOT BEAR TO LIVE AT WOODHAM SHE REMARKED WITHA SHIVER BUT IT IS MY FATE. WELL I AM OLD AND A WIDOW NOW IT DOESNOT MATTER WHERE I LIVE.THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING BUT ALDYTH COULD NOT WONDER AT HER MOTHERSDEPRESSION.NOT OLD BEAUTIFUL AND DEAR SHE SAID PRESSING HER MOTHERS HAND.AND BRIGHTER DAYS WILL COME. WOODHAM DOES NOT ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS.I SHOULD HOPE NOT SAID GLADYS THROWING HERSELF BACK WITH A YAWNAS THEY PASSED THE LAST HOUSE BELONGING TO WOODHAM. SO THIS IS YOURCARRIAGE ALDYTH IT IS RATHER AN ANTIQUATED AFFAIR AND THE SPRINGSMIGHT BE EASIER. DOES YOUR COACHMAN ALWAYS DRIVE SO SLOWLYYES OLD JOHN HAS AN OBJECTION TO USING THE WHIP SAID ALDYTH. HEALWAYS LETS THE HORSES DROP INTO THIS JOGTROT. AND IT IS OF NO USESPEAKING TO HIM HE IS TOO OLD TO ALTER HIS WAYS.THEN I SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER COACHMAN IF I WERE YOU SAIDGLADYS.ALDYTH SHOOK HER HEAD.THAT WOULD NEVER DO SHE SAID. IT WOULD BREAK JOHNS HEART TO BESUPERSEDED.DRIPPING TREES DRIPPING EAVES A POOL UNDER THE FRONT WINDOWS AND ACLOUD OF VAPOUR RISING FROM THE POND MADE WYNDHAM HALL APPEAR ANYTHINGBUT A DESIRABLE RESIDENCE AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR. ALDYTHWAS GRIEVED THAT HER MOTHER SHOULD FIRST SEE HER FUTURE HOME IN SUCH ANUNFAVOURABLE ASPECT.MRS. STANTON IN HER SABLE ATTIRE HAD THE AIR OF A QUEEN IN EXILE ASSHE MOUNTED THE STEPS WHILST A SERVANT HELD AN UMBRELLA OVER HER.BUT MISS LORRAINES CHEERY FACE AS SHE CAME FORWARD TO WELCOME THEMSEEMED TO DEFY THE WEATHER.WHAT AN EVENING SHE SAID. YOU WILL THINK WE HAVE ALTOGETHER TOOMUCH WATER HERE. IT IS UNFORTUNATE. BUT WE MUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT.THE HOUSE IS SURELY DAMP SAID MRS. STANTON WITH A DREARYANTICIPATION OF RHEUMATISM.NOT IN THE LEAST SAID MISS LORRAINE BRISKLY THE WALLS ARE TOOTHICK FOR THAT. THERE NEVER WAS A WARMER DRIER HOUSE. THEY DO NOTBUILD SUCH HOUSES NOWADAYS.CERTAINLY THE DINING ROOM WHERE A BRIGHT FIRE WAS BURNING AND A MEALDAINTILY SET OUT LOOKED MORE CHEERFUL.BUT MRS. STANTONS SPIRITS DID NOT BEGIN TO REVIVE TILL ALDYTHCONDUCTED HER TO HER OWN ROOM. THIS WAS A PLEASANT APARTMENT WITHWINDOWS LOOKING SOUTHWARDS AND COMMANDING A PRETTY VIEW OF THESURROUNDING COUNTRY. A NEW CARPET HAD BEEN PUT DOWN LIGHT FRESH CHINTZDRAPED WINDOWS AND BED THERE WERE FLOWERS ON THE DRESSINGTABLE ANDGLANCING ROUND MRS. STANTON COULD SEE THAT HER TASTES AND COMFORTS HADBEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED. SHE APPRECIATED COMFORTS AND SHE GAVE A SIGHOF RELIEF NOT OF DESPAIR AS SHE SANK INTO AN EASYCHAIR BY THE WOODFIRE.THIS IS COSY SHE SAID. YES DEAR ALDYTH I CANNOT BUT BECOMFORTABLE HERE AND IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL NOT GO DOWN AGAINTONIGHT. MISS LORRAINE IS VERY KIND BUT I DO NOT FEEL EQUAL TO HERTALK JUST NOW.YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE MAMMA SAID ALDYTH DEFTLY REMOVING HERMOTHERS BONNET AND MANTLE. I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING TO EAT HERE IFYOU WOULD RATHER.YES DEAR MUCH RATHER MRS. STANTON SAID.AND HASTILY REMOVING HER OWN THINGS ALDYTH WENT DOWN STAIRS TO ARRANGEA TRAY FOR HER MOTHER WITH THE FOOD MOST LIKELY TO TEMPT HER APPETITE.MISS LORRAINE WATCHED HER AS SHE SET ABOUT THE TASK AND WAS STRUCKWITH THE BRIGHT HAPPY LOOK THE GIRLS FACE WORE.YOU LOOK VERY HAPPY ALDYTH SHE SAID. YOU ARE VERY GLAD TO HAVEYOUR MOTHER IN YOUR HOME.I AM HAPPY REPLIED ALDYTH WITH A SWEET GLAD SMILE AND IT IS HOMENOW.MISS LORRAINE HAD A FLEETING SENSE OF DISCONTENT. SHE WONDERED WHAT HERUNCLE STEPHEN WOULD HAVE FELT IF HE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS RESULTOF ALDYTHS INHERITANCE AND SMILED TO THINK THAT HAD SUCH AN IDEAOCCURRED TO HIM HE WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE LEFT WYNDHAM TO GUY. SHE COULDIMAGINE HER UNCLE PASSING AT MIDNIGHT AS A RESTLESS GHOST THROUGH THEOLD HALL AND GROANING AT THE SIGHT OF THE HUGE TRUNKS BELONGING TOMRS. STANTON AND GLADYS WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED IN A CART FROM THESTATION AND WERE PILED UP IN THE HALL TILL THEY COULD BE EMPTIED OFTHEIR CONTENTS AND CONSIGNED TO THE LUMBER ROOM.AH ME SHE REFLECTED SAGELY. IT IS WELL WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT IS TOCOME AFTER US AND REALLY IT IS TIME THERE WAS SOME FRESH LIFE ABOUTTHE OLD PLACE.CHAPTER XXIV.A SECRET SORROW.   NOR KNOW WE ANYTHING SO FAIR    AS IS THE SMILE UPON THY FACE.THESE WORDS WERE IN ALDYTHS MIND AS SHE SPRANG UP THE NEXT MORNING.THE NEW DUTY WHICH HAD COME TO HER THE DUTY OF MAKING A HOME FORHER MOTHER AND SISTERS AND DOING ALL IN HER POWER TO PROMOTE THEIRHAPPINESS WAS VERY PLEASANT TO THE GIRLS LOVING HEART. IT WAS ANEASY TRANSITION FROM WORDSWORTHS FAMILIAR ODE TO THE THOUGHT OF JOHNGLYNNE. SHE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD ONCE SPOKEN TO HER OF THE POEM. HEHAD APPEARED TO FEEL STRONGLY THE FORCE OF THE EPITHET STERN AS APPLIEDTO DUTY. BUT DUTY HAD NO STERNNESS FOR ALDYTH AT THIS MOMENT HERINHERITANCE HAD CEASED TO BE A BURDEN NOW THAT SHE COULD SHARE IT WITHOTHERS.THE THOUGHT OF JOHN GLYNNE LINGERED IN ALDYTHS MIND WHILE SHE WASDRESSING. SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE DATE HAD PASSED AT WHICH THE GRAMMARSCHOOL USUALLY REOPENED SO NO DOUBT JOHN GLYNNE HAD RETURNED TOWOODHAM. THE YEAR HAD ALMOST COME ROUND TO THE PERIOD AT WHICH LASTYEAR HE BEGAN HIS COURSE OF LECTURES. WOULD HE BE PERSUADED TO GIVEANOTHER COURSE THIS AUTUMN ALDYTH HOPED SO WITH ALL HER HEART. SHEFELT EAGER TO ASK HER AUNT IF ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE. IFMR. GLYNNE GAVE LECTURES SHE MEANT TO ATTEND THEM. THERE WAS ASSUREDLYNO GOOD REASON WHY SHE SHOULD NOT. THE DISTANCE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED ADIFFICULTY BUT SHE COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE AND IF OLD JOHN OBJECTEDTO BEING KEPT OUT SO LATE SHE WOULD ASK HER AUNT TO LET HER STAY ATTHE COTTAGE FOR THE NIGHT.THE PLEASANT PROSPECT SUGGESTED BY THE LECTURES HEIGHTENED THE GOODSPIRITS IN WHICH ALDYTH HAD AWOKE. AS SHE DREW UP HER BLIND SHE SAWWITH SATISFACTION THAT THOUGH CLOUDS STILL HUNG LOW IN THE SKY THESUN WAS SHINING ON THE SOAKED LAWN AND WELLWASHED TREES. SHE HASTENEDTO HER MOTHERS ROOM.MRS. STANTON CONFESSED TO HAVING SLEPT PRETTY WELL BUT FELT UNEQUALTO RISING AT PRESENT.ALDYTH NEXT VISITED HER SISTER.THAT YOUNG LADY STILL LAY IN HER BED LOOKING CHARMINGLY AT HER EASEAND PERFECTLY WELL BUT SHE AT ONCE CONSENTED TO ALDYTHS PROPOSAL THATHER BREAKFAST SHOULD BE SENT TO HER.WHAT A CURIOUS OLD ROOM THIS IS GLADYS SAID LOOKING ABOUT HER WITHAMUSED EYES. DO YOU KNOW I WAS HORRIBLY AFRAID LAST NIGHT THAT A GHOSTWOULD WALK OUT OF THAT CUPBOARD AND I NEVER SLEPT ON A BEDSTEAD OFTHIS DESCRIPTION BEFORE. IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I WERE QUEEN ELIZABETHOR SOME ONE REMARKABLE. DID QUEEN ELIZABETH EVER COME TO WYNDHAMNOT THAT I AM AWARE OF SAID ALDYTH SMILING.THEN I NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF HER GHOST SAID GLADYS. SHALL I ALWAYSSLEEP HERENOT IF THERE IS ANOTHER ROOM YOU LIKE BETTER SAID ALDYTH. I COULDNOT BUT GIVE MAMMA AND AUNT THE BEST ROOMS LAST NIGHT.

BUT I FORGET THAT I AM INMOURNING. I SHALL HAVE TO WEAR MY OLDBLACK ONE I SUPPOSE. WHAT ABOREWELL AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET YOUR HABIT UNPACKED WE WILL SEE ABOUT ARIDEWEATHER PERMITTING ALDYTH SAID.AND SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS LEAVING GLADYS IN THE BEST OF HUMOURS.ALDYTH AND HER AUNT WHO HAD STAYED THE NIGHT AT WYNDHAM BREAKFASTEDTOGETHER.AUNTIE SAID ALDYTH AS SHE CAME BACK FROM CARRYING HER MOTHERSBREAKFAST TO HER ARE THERE TO BE LECTURES AT WYNDHAM THIS AUTUMNAH I AM AFRAID NOT SAID MISS LORRAINE SHAKING HER HEAD. I HAVENOT TOLD YOU THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE MR. GLYNNE.TO LOSE MR.

HE HAS GOT A GOOD APPOINTMENTABROADTHE HEAD MASTERSHIP OF SOME SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AT THE CAPE IBELIEVE.ALDYTH HASTILY SEATED HERSELF BEHIND THE URN. SHE FELT THAT SHE HADGROWN WHITE AND COLD THE NEWS WAS AFFECTING HER IN A WAY SHE COULDHARDLY UNDERSTAND.HOW SOON DOES HE LEAVE SHE VENTURED TO ASK AFTER A MINUTE.OH HIS CONNECTION WITH THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL IS ALREADY SEVERED SAIDHER AUNT. DR. WHEELER ALLOWED A FRIEND OF MR. GLYNNES TO TAKE HISPLACE. OF COURSE THE BOYS DO NOT LIKE IT AND THEIR PARENTS ARE ALLSORRY TO LOSE MR. GLYNNE.ALDYTH SILENTLY BUSIED HERSELF WITH THE COFFEE. HER HANDS TREMBLED ASSHE LIFTED THE CUPS.THEN I SHALL SEE HIM NO MORE WAS THE THOUGHT THAT PRESSED PAINFULLYON HER MIND.HE IS COMING DOWN HERE AGAIN FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE HE LEAVES THECOUNTRY SAID MISS LORRAINE AFTER A PAUSE JUST TO GET HIS THINGSAND SAY GOODBYE TO HIS FRIENDS YOU KNOW.

AS YOU KNOW I TOOKTO HIM FROM THE FIRST. ONE DOES NOT MEET WITH SUCH A MAN EVERY DAY. ITWILL BE A GRIEF TO HIS MOTHER TO PART WITH HIM.YES SAID ALDYTH FINDING IT EASY TO RESPOND TO THIS REMARK.MISS LORRAINE TALKED ON DISCUSSING THE EVENT FROM VARIOUS POINTS OFVIEW AND APPARENTLY QUITE SATISFIED WITH ALDYTHS BRIEF REJOINDERS.ALDYTH MADE BUT A PRETENCE OF BREAKFASTING. SHE WAS OPPRESSED BY ASTRANGE HEARTSICKNESS WHICH TOOK AWAY ALL THE JOY OF HER RETURN ANDROBBED DUTY OF THE BRIGHT ASPECT IT HAD WORN TO HER THAT MORNING.I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD NOT STAY LONG AT WOODHAM SHE SAID TOHERSELF. HE WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM ANY ONE ELSE I EVER KNEW.THERE WERE VARIOUS LITTLE MATTERS AT WYNDHAM AWAITING ALDYTHSATTENTION. SHE WENT THROUGH THE BUSINESS OF THE MORNING WITH A WEIGHTOF DISAPPOINTMENT ON HER MIND. ABOUT NOON SHE HELPED HER MOTHER TODRESS. GLADYS WHO HAD BEEN LONG UP AND HAD MADE A TOUR OF THEHOUSE UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MISS LORRAINE MIGHT HAVE WAITED ON HERMOTHER BUT MRS. STANTON SEEMED TO PREFER THE ATTENTIONS OF HER ELDESTDAUGHTER AND GLADYS WILLINGLY GAVE PLACE TO ALDYTH.THE MORNING HAD BEEN SHOWERY BUT BY THE TIME THEY ALL MET AT LUNCHEONTHE SUN SEEMED TO HAVE CONQUERED THE CLOUDS AND THERE WAS THE PROSPECTOF A FINE AFTERNOON.ALDYTH ASKED HER AUNT WHO WAS ABOUT TO RETURN TO WOODHAM IF SHE WOULDLIKE TO DRIVE IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE.YES CERTAINLY IT WILL BE MUCH PLEASANTER SAID MISS LORRAINE. WILLYOU NOT COME WITH ME ALDYTHI DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MAMMA CAN SPARE ME SAID ALDYTH LOOKING AT HERMOTHER.BUT ERE MRS. STANTON COULD SPEAK GLADYS SAID EAGERLYOH DO LET MEGO ALDYTH.

YOU WILL FEEL SO DULL.NO DEAR IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ME TO REST QUIETLY SAID HER MOTHER. IWOULD RATHER YOU WENT INDEED.IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO AVAIL HERSELF OF THEOPPORTUNITY THUS AFFORDED TO WANDER THROUGH THE OLD HOUSE ALONE ORATTENDED BY THE HOUSEKEEPER WHOM SHE WISHED TO QUESTION ON MATTERSCONCERNING OLD MR. LORRAINE ABOUT WHICH SHE WAS CURIOUS.AFTER A LITTLE MORE PERSUASION ALDYTH CONSENTED TO LEAVE HER MOTHER TOHERSELF AND HALF AN HOUR LATER DROVE OFF WITH HER AUNT AND SISTER TOWOODHAM. MIDWAY THEY MET GUY ON HORSEBACK.ALDYTH FELT THE COLOUR RUSH INTO HER FACE AS SHE REMEMBERED THE LASTTALK SHE HAD HAD WITH HER COUSIN. BUT GUYS SANGFROID WAS EQUAL TOTHE OCCASION. NO ONE COULD LOOK MORE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY CAUSE FORCONSTRAINT. HE NODDED AND RAISED HIS HAT IN THE EASIEST MANNER INGREETING TO MISS LORRAINE AND ALDYTH AS HE REINED IN HIS HORSE THUSCOMPELLING ALDYTH TO DRAW UP ALSO THEN CAST A QUICK ADMIRING GLANCEAT THE PRETTY GIRL ON THE BACK SEAT WHOSE DELICATE COMPLEXION ANDSUNNY HAIR WERE THROWN INTO STRONG RELIEF BY HER SOMBRE ATTIRE.SO YOU HAVE COME BACK ALDYTH HE SAID CARELESSLY. WHEN DID YOUARRIVELAST EVENING SAID ALDYTH. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU GUY TO MY SISTERMISS STANTON.THE AIR OF ADMIRATION WITH WHICH GUY MADE HIS BOW WAS AGREEABLE TOGLADYS. SHE LIKED THE GLANCE THAT LINGERED UPON HER AND THE SMILE WITHWHICH HE SAIDYOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE COMING INTO A SECOND DELUGE WHEN YOUARRIVED LAST NIGHT MISS STANTON. I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WYNDHAM MUSTHAVE LOOKED TO YOU WITH THE FIELDS ABOUT IT ALL SWAMPED.GLADYS GAVE A LIGHT LITTLE LAUGH. IT HAD A DISMAL APPEARANCE I MUSTCONFESS SHE SAID. ALDYTH HAD PREPARED ME FOR A SCENE OF DESOLATIONBUT THE REALITY SURPASSED ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY IMAGINATION. I THOUGHTOF THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND PICTURED MYSELF SPENDING WEARY DAYS ANDNIGHTS WITHIN WATERGIRT WALLS. BUT HAPPILY THE SUNSHINE HAS RELIEVEDME OF THAT HORROR.WYNDHAM IS A DISMAL HOLE THOUGH SAID GUY. WOODHAM IS BAD ENOUGHBUT WYNDHAM IS A FEW DEGREES WORSE.DONT DEPRESS ME SAID GLADYS. I AM ON MY WAY TO DISCOVER ALL THEEXCITEMENTS YOUR TOWN CAN AFFORD.NOT MANY EXCITEMENTS I FEAR SAID MISS LORRAINE WHILST GUY SHRUGGEDHIS SHOULDERS SIGNIFICANTLY. AFTER ALL THE PLEASURES YOU HAVE ENJOYEDIN TOWN AND AT THE SEASIDE OUR AMUSEMENTS WILL SEEM VERY COMMONPLACE.BUT THERE ARE PLEASURES PECULIAR TO A COUNTRY LIFE ARE THERE NOTSAID GLADYS WITH AN AIR OF SIMPLICITY. HAYMAKING FOR INSTANCE.I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY THAT. I CAN FANCY MYSELF IN A GREAT HAT WITHA PITCHFORK IN MY HAND TOSSING THE HAY. IT WOULD BE SO CHARMINGLYIDYLLIC.IT WOULD BE IF YOU TURNED HAYMAKER SAID GUY WITH A MEANING GLANCEUNFORTUNATELY THE HAYHARVEST IS OVER BUT THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRYOCCUPATIONSTHERE IS THE SHOOTING NOW YOU KNOW. BUT I FORGET LADIESDO NOT SHOOT. THEY HUNT THOUGH OCCASIONALLY.AH THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO DO SAID GLADYS IF WE DO NOTSHARE IT WE LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR SPORT. DO COME IN SOMETIMES ANDTELL US HOW THE SHOOTING GOES.WITH PLEASURE SAID GUY AS ALDYTH GAVE HER HORSE A TOUCH AND ITMOVED ON.GUY LOOKED HIS BEST ON HORSEBACK AND GLADYS WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY HERINTRODUCTION TO HIM.YOU NEVER TOLD ME ALDYTH SHE SAID HOW VERY GOODLOOKING YOURCOUSIN WAS.DO YOU THINK HIM SO ALDYTH SAID.THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT GUY IS A HANDSOME MAN SAID MISS LORRAINEDECISIVELY ONE SELDOM SEES SUCH REGULAR WELLCUT FEATURES.HANDSOME IS THAT HANDSOME DOES ALDYTH REMINDED HERSELF AS SHETHOUGHT OF THE SUFFERING THAT ATTRACTIVE PERSON HAD INFLICTED ON HILDABLAND.HAVING DRIVEN TO MYRTLE COTTAGE AND SEEN MISS LORRAINE AND HERPACKAGES DULY RECEIVED BY THE LITTLE HOUSEMAID THE GIRLS DROVE ONSLOWLY DOWN THE HIGH STREET GLADYS GLANCING ABOUT HER WITH AMUSEMENTAND WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS AN OBJECT OF ATTENTION.HOW THE PEOPLE DO STARE SHE SAID. ONE WOULD THINK THEY NEVER SAW ASTRANGER. REALLY THIS IS QUITE BUSTLING ALDYTH. I DID NOT EXPECT TOSEE SUCH A CROWDED THOROUGHFARE. IT REMINDS ME OF BOND STREET IN THESEASON.IT DOES NOT REMIND ME OF BOND STREET SAID ALDYTH SMILING. THISLARGE HOUSE ON THE RIGHT IS THE HOME OF MY FRIENDS THE BLANDS BUTKITTY AND HILDA ARE AWAY JUST NOW.IS NOT HILDA BLAND THE GIRL TO WHOM YOUR COUSIN WAS ENGAGED ASKEDGLADYS.YES SAID ALDYTH RELUCTANTLY NOT WISHING TO DISCUSS THAT SUBJECTWITH GLADYS.WHOSE FAULT WAS IT THAT THE ENGAGEMENT CAME TO NOUGHT ASKED GLADYS.DID SHE CARE MUCH FOR HIMA GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE DESERVED SAID ALDYTH HER TONES IN SPITEOF HERSELF EXPRESSING INDIGNATION.GIRLS ARE SILLIES SAID GLADYS EMPHATICALLY. THERE NEVER YET WAS AMAN WORTH BREAKING ONES HEART FOR. BUT WHO IS THIS ONE COMING TOWARDSUS ALDYTH HE LOOKS RATHER NICE.ALDYTH HAD ALREADY RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION AND HER HEARTHAD GIVEN A LEAP AT THE SIGHT OF HIM BUT SHE ANSWERED QUIETLY ENOUGHTHAT IS MR. GLYNNE. HE WAS ONE OF THE MASTERS AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLBUT HE IS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE TOWN.WHAT A PITY I LIKE THE LOOK OF HIM SAID GLADYS. HE IS NOTGOODLOOKING BUT HE HAS THE AIR OF A GENTLEMAN.HE IS A GENTLEMAN ALDYTH COULD NOT HELP SAYING.SHE WAS DRAWING IN HER HORSE BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE LIBRARY WHEN HECAME IN SIGHT ROUND A TURN IN THE STREET. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FORHIM AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO ALIGHT TO STEP ACROSS THE STREET TO SPEAKTO ALDYTH BUT THE IDEA DID NOT APPEAR TO OCCUR TO HIM. HE LIFTED HISHAT COURTEOUSLY AND PASSED ON ALONG THE OPPOSITE PAVEMENT.A KEEN CRUEL PAIN SEIZED UPON ALDYTH. SHE HARDLY HEARD THE REMARKSGLADYS WAS MAKING OR KNEW HOW SHE TRANSACTED THE BUSINESS THAT TOOKHER INTO THE SHOP. ONE THOUGHT POSSESSED HERTHE THOUGHT THAT JOHNGLYNNE HAD ONLY COME FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THAT HE WOULD GO AWAYWITHOUT HER HAVING EXCHANGED A WORD WITH HIM. AND YET HE COULD HAVESPOKEN TO HER THEN AND HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO CROSS THE ROADTHAT HE MIGHT DO SO IT WAS MOST MORTIFYING TO BE TREATED SO BY ONEWHOM SHE HAD COUNTED A FRIEND.WITH A SENSE OF INTOLERABLE SHAME ALDYTH TOOK HERSELF TO TASK FORFEELING MORE INTEREST IN JOHN GLYNNE THAN HE APPARENTLY FELT IN HER.BUT THOUGH SHE WAS ASHAMED OF IT THE FEELING WAS NOT TO BE CRUSHED INA MOMENT. THOUGHTS FULL OF PAIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT OCCUPIED HER MIND ASTHEY DROVE HOME MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO PAY PROPER ATTENTION TOWHAT GLADYS WAS SAYING.IT IS GROWING COLD GLADYS REMARKED WITH A SHIVER AS THEY TURNEDINTO THE CARRIAGE DRIVE TO WYNDHAM THE DAYS ARE SO SHORT NOW. IT WILLSOON BE WINTER.ALDYTH ROUSED HERSELF WITH AN EFFORT AND TRIED TO RECOVER A BRIGHTDEMEANOUR ERE SHE SAW HER MOTHER BUT SHE FELT AS IF WINTER HAD ALREADYBEGUN.CHAPTER XXV.HOW MRS. STANTON SPENT HER FIRST AFTERNOON AT WYNDHAM.MRS. STANTON SAT ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR AN HOUR AFTER THE OTHERSHAD DRIVEN AWAY. ALDYTH HAD CONVERTED THIS INTO A VERY PRETTY ROOM.EVEN MRS. STANTON COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH THE TASTE SHE HAD DISPLAYEDIN BRINGING OUT ALL THAT WAS PICTURESQUE IN THE OLD FURNITURE ANDBLENDING WITH IT MODERN ARTISTIC DRAPERIES AND VARIOUS OBJECTS OFMODERN ANTIQUE. THE CHAIR IN WHICH MRS. STANTON RECLINED WAS OF THEEASIEST THE LONG FRENCH WINDOW BY WHICH SHE SAT LOOKED OUT ON ASTRETCH OF SUNLIT LAWN WITH SOME BRIGHT DAHLIAS BLOOMING AGAINST THEBOX HEDGE AND SOME FINE OLD TREES RISING BEYOND.MRS. STANTONS MOOD AS SHE SAT THERE WAS ONE OF QUIET HALFMELANCHOLYCONTENT. SHE WAS FAR FROM BEING CRUSHED BY HER BEREAVEMENT. HERAFFECTION FOR HER HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN OF SUCH A CLINGING PENETRATINGNATURE AS TO MAKE LIFE SEEM IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HIM. SHE HAD TAKEN THELEAD IN THEIR LIFE MAKING HIS WILL GIVE PLACE TO HERS AND SHE NOWFELT QUITE CAPABLE OF ORDERING HER OWN LIFE AND THAT OF HER CHILDREN.AS SHE REVIEWED THE PAST AND LOOKED FORWARD TO THE FUTURE HER THOUGHTSTOOK THE FORM OF SELFCONGRATULATION. SHE WAS MOVED TO THANKFULNESSTHAT THINGS WERE AS THEY WERE. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT. WHATA FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IT WAS THAT ALDYTH SHOULD INHERIT A FORTUNEJUST WHEN HER MOTHER WAS ABOUT TO LOSE EVERYTHING FOR THAT ALL WASGONE MRS. STANTON FELT CONVINCED FROM WHAT HER HUSBAND HAD TOLD HER OFHIS AFFAIRS THOUGH SHE WAS YET AWAITING THE PARTICULARS THAT THE NEXTMAIL WOULD BRING.MRS. STANTON HAD SOME FANCY WORK IN HER LAP BUT SHE FELT A DISTASTEFOR ANY OCCUPATION. IT WAS EASIER TO LEAN BACK AND GIVE HERSELF UP TODAYDREAMS. PRESENTLY HER IMAGINATION WAS FILLING THE LONG DRAWING ROOMWITH A PARTY OF VISITORS.THE PLACE IS DULL SHE THOUGHT BUT OUR LIFE HERE NEED NOT BE DULL.A COUNTRY HOUSE IS PLEASANT ENOUGH WHEN IT IS FULL OF GUESTS. WHEN APROPER TIME HAS PASSED WE CAN INVITE WHOM WE LIKE. THERE ARE SURELYSOME NICE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. WE CAN GIVE DINNER PARTIES ANDTENNISPARTIES AND DANCES. WE MUST DO SO FOR GLADYSS SAKE. CAPTAINWALKER COULD COME OVER FROM COLCHESTER CECIL COULD BRING SOME OF HISFRIENDS FROM LONDON. WE COULD GO UP TO TOWN FOR A FEW WEEKS IN THESEASON PERHAPS. I SUPPOSE ALDYTH COULD AFFORD IT. SHE HAS NEVER TOLDME WHAT HER INCOME IS PERHAPS SHE DOES NOT YET KNOW HERSELF BUT ITCAN HARDLY BE LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND AND THAT WOULD COVER A GOODMANY EXPENSES.AS SHE THOUGHT THUS MRS. STANTON GREW WEARY OF INACTION. SHE WASNATURALLY ROBUST AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK OFTROUBLE WHICH HAD NOT MADE HER REALLY ILL. SHE BETHOUGHT HER THATSHE SHOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE AND MAKE HERSELF THOROUGHLYACQUAINTED WITH WHAT SHE ALREADY REGARDED AS HER OWN DOMAIN.AS SHE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE REFLECTIONOF HERSELF IN A LONG MIRROR OPPOSITE AND WAS STRUCK WITH THE MAJESTICGRACE OF HER TALL FINE FIGURE IN ITS FLOWING BLACK ROBE. AFTER ALL SHEWAS NOT OLD OR INSIGNIFICANT YET LIFE MUST STILL HAVE PLEASANT THINGSIN STORE FOR HER. AND THERE WAS A REVIVAL OF ENERGY MANIFEST IN HERLOOK AND BEARING AS SHE WALKED FROM THE ROOM.SHE STARTED ON HER TOUR OF INSPECTION ALONE BUT PRESENTLY FOUND HERPROGRESS BARRED BY LOCKED DOORS SO RETURNING TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHERANG THE BELL AND SUMMONED THE HOUSE KEEPER TO HER PRESENCE.MRS. ROGERS CAME READILY FOR SHE IN COMMON WITH THE OTHER SERVANTSFELT MUCH INTEREST IN THE BEAUTIFUL ELEGANT WIDOW WHO HAD TAKEN UPHER ABODE AT THE HALL. MRS. ROGERS WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THETIME WHEN THIS LADY THEN A LOVELY HIGHSPIRITED GIRL HAD BEEN THEBELLE OF COLCHESTER AND HOW HER MARRIAGE WITH CAPTAIN LORRAINE ANDHIS CONSEQUENT DISFAVOUR WITH HIS UNCLE HAD SET EVERY ONE TALKING. THEHOUSEKEEPER ENTERED WITH AN INGRATIATING SMILE ON HER FACE AND DROPPEDAN OLDFASHIONED CURTSEY AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE LADY.I THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A TURN THROUGH THE ROOMS IT WOULDHELP TO PASS THE TIME SAID MRS. STANTON BUT I FIND SEVERAL OF THEDOORS LOCKED.AH YES MAAM I KEEP THE ROOMS LOCKED THAT ARE NOT IN USE. REPLIEDTHE OLD WOMAN. MISS ALDYTH BEING HERE SO LITTLE I THOUGHT IT BEST TODO SO. THERES ONE ROOM FULL OF MR. GUYS THINGS. AND I HAVE THE KEYOF THE LIBRARY AND THE KEYS OF THE BUREAU TOO. MR. GREENWOOD TOLD METO LOCK THE ROOM THE DAY AFTER THE SQUIRE DIED. WHEN EITHER OF THE MR.GREENWOODS CAME I GAVE THE KEY TO THEM AND WHEN THEY WENT AWAY THEYLOCKED THE DOOR AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO ME. AND MISS ALDYTH SHE SAIDID BETTER KEEP THE KEYS OF THE BUREAU TOO IN CASE THEY WERE WANTEDFOR YOU SEE MISS ALDYTH WAS NOT ALWAYS HERE. SHE WENT HOME WITH MISSLORRAINE A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE FUNERAL. BUT ILL FETCH THE KEYS FORYOU MAAM.THANK YOU SAID MRS. STANTON SEATING HERSELF WITH AN AIR OF LEISURE.IN A FEW MOMENTS MRS. ROGERS RETURNED WITH HER KEYBASKET. PERHAPSI HAD BETTER GO WITH YOU MAAM SHE SUGGESTED. I FEAR YOU MAY FINDSOME OF THE LOCKS RATHER STIFF AND THE ROOMS A BIT DUSTY.NO THANK YOU I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME REPLIED MRS. STANTONLANGUIDLY. I DARE SAY I SHALL NOT INVESTIGATE VERY FAR AND I DO NOTCARE TO FEEL HURRIED.VERY WELL MAAM BUT IF SO BE YOU SHOULD WANT ME ILL COME IN AMINUTE.YOUVE BEEN AT THE HALL A GOOD MANY YEARS I BELIEVE SAID MRS.STANTON.MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS MAAM.AH THEN YOUVE SEEN MANY CHANGES. YOU WOULD REMEMBER CAPTAINLORRAINE.YES INDEED MAAM. I REMEMBER HIM WELL. AS NICE A GENTLEMAN AS EVERWAS. AND MISS ALDYTHS AS LIKE HIM AS CAN BE. IT SEEMS ONLY RIGHT THATSHE SHOULD BE HERE IN HIS STEAD THOUGH I AM SORRY FOR MR. GUY.AH I HAVE NOT YET THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE SAID MRS.STANTON BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD I SHOULD IMAGINE HIM AN AGREEABLEYOUNG MAN.HE IS THAT MAAM. THERES NO ONE ABOUT HERE BUT IS FOND OF MR. GUY.IT WAS A PITY THAT HE OFFENDED HIS UNCLENOT BUT WHAT WERE ALL VERYPLEASED TO HAVE MISS ALDYTH HERE THOUGH IF IT COULD HAVE BEENBUTTHERE THINGS MAY COME RIGHT YET. THERES MANY A ONE SAYS THEY WILL.BUT HERE MRS. ROGERS SAW SOMETHING IN THE LADYS EXPRESSION THAT MADEHER CHECK HER GARRULOUS TALK.MRS. STANTON WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO READ WHAT WAS IN THE OLD WOMANS MINDBUT SHE SHOWED NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT.MR. STEPHEN LORRAINE WAS ONE EASILY OFFENDED WAS HE NOT SHE ASKED.AY THAT HE WAS MAAM AND HE WAS ONE THAT WOULD NEVER GO FROM HISWORD. IF ANY SERVANT OFFENDED HIM THAT SERVANT HAD TO LEAVE FORTHWITH.IT WAS OF NO USE TO TRY AND PERSUADE HIM TO OVERLOOK A FAULT HEWOULD NOT DO THAT THOUGH IT VEXED HIM TO PART WITH THEM. IT SEEMEDIMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO FORGIVE.AND WHEN WAS IT THAT MR. GUY WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO DISPLEASE HISUNCLEAT THE END OF LAST YEAR MAAM. WE COULD ALL TELL THAT THERE WASSOMETHING WRONG BETWEEN THEM AND WHEN MR. GREENWOOD CAME OUT ON NEWYEARS DAY I GUESSED WHAT IT MEANT.MRS. STANTON LET THE HOUSEKEEPER TALK ON FOR SOME TIME OCCASIONALLYINTERRUPTING HER WITH A QUESTION. BUT AT LAST WEARYING OF HERGARRULITY SHE DISMISSED HER AND SET OFF AGAIN TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE.THE CLOSED ROOMS PROVED OLDFASHIONED AND DINGY WITH THE CLOSE MUSTYATMOSPHERE UNUSED CHAMBERS SO SOON ACQUIRE. MRS. STANTON DID NOT CARETO LINGER IN THEM. SHE FOUND LITTLE TO INTEREST HER TILL SHE CAME TOTHE LIBRARY. THE AIR OF THAT APARTMENT TOO WAS OPPRESSIVE AND SHEHASTENED TO OPEN THE LONG WINDOW WHICH LOOKED ON TO THE LAWN. THE SOFTBREEZE WHICH ENTERED WAS REFRESHING AND SHE SANK ON TO A CHAIR BY THEWINDOW AND FELL TO MUSING ON WHAT THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER HAD TOLD HER.SO THERE WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT THAT THINGS WOULD YET BE MADE RIGHT FORGUY BY HIS MARRIAGE WITH HIS COUSIN. WAS THIS THE MOTIVE THAT HAD LEDHIM TO BREAK HIS ENGAGEMENT TO HILDA BLAND MRS. STANTON COULD EASILYBELIEVE THAT IT WAS SO. INDEED AS SHE PONDERED IT THE CASE HARDLYSEEMED TO ADMIT OF A DOUBT NOR WAS SHE INCLINED TO BLAME HIM SEVERELYFOR WHAT SEEMED TO HER A MOST NATURAL LINE OF ACTION. BUT NOTHING NOWCOULD BE FURTHER FROM HER DESIRES THAN THE FULFILMENT OF THE HOPE SHEATTRIBUTED TO HIM. IF GUY WEDDED ALDYTH WYNDHAM HALL COULD NO LONGERBE THE HOME OF HERSELF AND DAUGHTERS AND THE DELIGHTFUL VISIONS INWHICH SHE HAD BEEN INDULGING MUST COME TO NOUGHT FOR IT WAS NOTTO BE SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD TOLERATE THE CONSTANT PRESENCE IN HISHOME OF HIS WIFES MOTHER NOR WOULD SHE WISH TO REMAIN UNDER SUCHCIRCUMSTANCES.BUT WAS IT PROBABLE THAT ALDYTH WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO ACCEPT GUYNOW THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE HER MOTHER COULD HARDLY FEAR IT AS SHEREMEMBERED THE EMPHATIC WAY IN WHICH ALDYTH HAD REPUDIATED THE IDEA.SHE WILL NOT UNLESS SHE IS MOVED BY SOME QUIXOTIC DESIRE TO RESTORETHE PROPERTY TO HIM REFLECTED MRS. STANTON AND I WILL DO ALL IN MYPOWER TO PREVENT THAT.WITH THIS RESOLVE SHE DISMISSED THE UNWELCOME THOUGHT AND GAVE HERATTENTION TO HER SURROUNDINGS.THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE SAT WAS THAT IN WHICH OLD STEPHEN LORRAINE HADSPENT MOST OF HIS TIME WHEN INDOORS. A GLANCE ROUND IT SUFFICED TOPROVE THAT HIS TASTES WERE NOT LITERARY. THOUGH IT WAS KNOWN AS THELIBRARY THE BOOKS IT CONTAINED WERE FEW AND NOT OF AN INVITINGAPPEARANCE. THEY LOOKED AS IF THEY MIGHT HAVE STOOD UNTOUCHED ON THESHELVES FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. ABOVE THE MANTELPIECE HUNG TOKENS OFTHE LOVE OF SPORT THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED STEPHEN LORRAINE IN EARLIERYEARS. VARIOUS GUNS NOT OF THE MOST MODERN CONSTRUCTION WERE TOBE SEEN THERE A VERY OLD FISHINGROD AND THE BRUSH OF A FOX. THEPORTRAIT OF A FAVOURITE HUNTER PAINTED BY A LOCAL ARTIST HUNG ON THEOPPOSITE WALL PAIRING WITH THE PICTURE OF A PRIZE BULL FROM WHICH ITWAS DIVIDED BY A LARGE HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE SKETCH OF A GROUP OF SHEEPWHICH HAD THRIVEN ON A CERTAIN MUCHADVERTISED FOOD.BUT WHAT MOST ATTRACTED MRS. STANTONS ATTENTION WAS A QUAINT ANTIQUEBUREAU WHICH STOOD FULL IN HER VIEW AS SHE SAT BY THE WINDOW. NOUPHOLSTERERS SHOP COULD FURNISH SUCH AN ARTICLE AT THE PRESENT TIMESO STRONGLY MADE SO CUNNINGLY DEVISED WITH ITS HANGING BRASS HANDLESAND LAVISHLYDISPOSED BRASS NAILS. THIS SURELY MUST BE THE OLD BUREAUOF WHICH SHE REMEMBERED BEARING HER FIRST HUSBAND SPEAK. HE HAD SPOKENOF IT AS A MOST CURIOUS PIECE OF FURNITURE WITH NUMEROUS PIGEONHOLESSLIDING PANELS STRANGE UNEXPECTED RECESSES.AS SHE LOOKED AT THE BUREAU A LONGING TO EXPLORE IT TOOK POSSESSIONOF MRS. STANTONS MIND. WHY NOT HERE IN THE BASKET SHE HELD WAS THEKEY OF THE BUREAU. THIS LONG CURIOUSLYFORMED KEY WOULD OPEN THE MAINLOCK AND THESE SMALL KEYS MUST BELONG TO THE INNER DRAWERS. WHY SHOULDSHE NOT LOOK INTO THE BUREAU ITS OWNER FOR SO MANY YEARS HAD PASSEDAWAY THE BUREAU AND ALL IT CONTAINED WAS NOW ALDYTHS PROPERTY THERECOULD BE NO HARM IN ALDYTHS MOTHER OPENING IT. ALDYTH WOULD CERTAINLYBE WILLING THAT SHE SHOULD.BUT THOUGH SHE TOLD HERSELF THIS MRS. STANTON HESITATED. IN HER INMOSTSOUL SHE COULD NOT FEEL SURE THAT IT WAS RIGHT FOR HER THUS ALONETO EXAMINE THE THINGS THAT OLD STEPHEN LORRAINE HAD KEPT HIDDEN FROMOTHERS. SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE DID SO SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SPEAK OF ITTO HER DAUGHTER.SHE TURNED FROM THE BUREAU. SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW ON TOTHE GRAVEL PATH AND TOOK ONE OR TWO TURNS UP AND DOWN THE LENGTH OFTHE LAWN. THE TEMPTATION GREW STRONGER AS SHE LINGERED. ALL WAS STILLABOUT HER THERE WAS NOT EVEN A GARDENER IN SIGHT. MRS. ROGERS AND THESERVANTS WERE IN THEIR OWN QUARTERS THERE SEEMED NO CAUSE TO FEARDISTURBANCE.YOU WILL NEVER HAVE SO GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY AGAIN A VOICE SAID WITHINHER.SHE REENTERED THE LIBRARY. LIKE MANY ANOTHER DAUGHTER OF EVE SHELOOKED AT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT TILL IT GREW IRRESISTIBLE.WHY SHOULD I NOT SHE ASKED HERSELF AGAIN AS SHE DREW A CHAIR INFRONT OF THE BUREAU AND SEATED HERSELF. THE LAWYER MUST HAVE LOOKED ATALL IT CONTAINS SO WHY SHOULD NOT ISHE TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND THE BUREAU OPENED OUT EASILY. THESLOPING DESK DARK WITH AGE AND INKSTAINS BORE WITNESS TO A LONGTERM OF SERVICE. BEHIND RAN TWO ROWS OF PIGEONHOLES. THESE CONTAINEDRECEIPTED BILLS INVOICES BUSINESS LETTERS NOTHING THAT COULDINTEREST HER. BUT A ROW OF LOCKED DRAWERS AT THE SIDE YIELDED MOREINTERESTING MATTER. HERE WERE NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS REFERRING TO EVENTSTHAT SHE COULD REMEMBER PRIVATE LETTERS WHICH SHE DID NOT HESITATE TOSCAN AND PRESENTLY CLOSELY WRAPPED IN WHITE PAPER SHE FOUND A LOCKOF A WOMANS HAIR.SHE DID NOT THINK OF A LIKE DISCOVERY IN THE DESK OF SWIFT WITH ITSHALFSAVAGE WHOLLY PATHETIC DESCRIPTION ONLY A WOMANS HAIR BUTSHE WONDERED AT THIS REVELATION OF A CHERISHED SENTIMENT IN THE BREASTOF THE OLD MAN WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS HARSH AND UNFEELING.WHOSE HAIR HAD THIS BEENHIS MOTHERS OR A GIFT FROM THAT TABITHARUDKIN WHOSE NAME SHE HAD HEARD LAUGHINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS YOUTHAND WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS MOROCCO CASE WHICH LAY IN THE SAMEDRAWER SHE OPENED IT AND SAW THE MINIATURE OF A LOVELY GIRL WITHCLEAR COMPLEXION SOFT GREY EYES AND MASSES OF DARK CURLS BUNCHED ONEITHER SIDE HER FOREHEAD AFTER THE FASHION OF HER DAY. SO YOUNG ANDFAIR SHE LOOKED BUT HER YOUTHFUL CHARMS HAD LONG FADED AND THE YEARSWERE MANY SINCE AT A MATURE AGE DEATH SET HIS SEAL TO HER LIFE FOR AFEW WORDS INSCRIBED WITHIN THE CASE TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE PORTRAIT OFOLD STEPHENS MOTHER WHO HAD DIED AT THE AGE OF FIFTYFIVE.MRS. STANTON CLOSED THE CASE WITH A SHIVER. SHE DID NOT LIKE TO BEREMINDED OF THE INEVITABLE LOT AND THE EVANESCENCE OF BEAUTY ANDJOY. SHE TRIED TO SHUT THE DRAWER BUT SOMETHING WAS WRONG SHE COULDNOT GET IT BACK INTO ITS PLACE. THEN SHE SAW THAT THE FRAMEWORK OFTHE DRAWERS WAS SOMEHOW AWRY. INADVERTENTLY SHE MUST HAVE TOUCHED AHIDDEN SPRING FOR NOW AT A SECOND PULL THE WHOLE NEST OF DRAWERSSWUNG TO ONE SIDE AND REVEALED A HOLLOW SPACE BEHIND FITTED UP WITHPIGEONHOLES. HERE WAS ONE OF THE SECRET RECESSES OF WHICH SHE HADHEARD.BUT IT WAS EMPTY. NO. WHAT WAS THAT IN THE FURTHEST PARTITION MRS.STANTON PUT IN HER HAND AND DREW FORTH A LONG BLUE ROLL. BUT AS HEREYES FELL ON CERTAIN WORDS WRITTEN ON IT SHE STARTED AND RECOILED ASTHOUGH A SERPENT HAD BITTEN HER.LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF STEPHEN LORRAINE. WHAT HAD SHE FOUNDANOTHER WILL BUT NOT A VALID ONETHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.AS THE THOUGHT FLASHED THROUGH HER MIND SHE WAS UNROLLING THE DOCUMENTWITH TREMBLING HANDS. THE DATE WAS APRIL OF THE PRESENT YEAR. AND MRS.ROGERS HAD SAID THAT THE OTHER WILL WAS MADE ON NEW YEARS DAY THISWAS A LATER WILL.SHE GREW COLD AND FAINT AS THE THOUGHT CAME TO HER THAT THIS WILL MIGHTALTER EVERYTHINGWYNDHAM MIGHT NOT BE ALDYTHS IT MIGHT NOT BE IN HERPOWER TO GIVE A HOME TO HER MOTHER AND SISTERS. MRS. STANTON FELT THATSHE MUST READ THE WILL SHE MUST GET TO KNOW WHAT ITS PROVISIONS WERE.FORCING HER MIND TO THE TASK SHE SLOWLY READ THROUGH THE WILLGRASPING WITH DIFFICULTY THE MEANING OF THE LEGAL WORDS. WHEN SHE HADFINISHED HER FACE WAS WHITE AND HER BREATH CAME QUICKLY. THAT FIRSTPRESENTIMENT ALAS WAS CONFIRMED. THE WILL CHANGED ALL. IT MADEWYNDHAM AND THE BULK OF THE PROPERTY TOGETHER WITH THE FARM AT WOODCORNER OVER TO GUY LORRAINE AND LEFT ALDYTH WITH SIX THOUSAND POUNDS.MRS. STANTON HAD AN INSTANTANEOUS PERCEPTION OF ALL THAT THIS FACTMEANT FOR HER. SHE DID NOT DOUBT THAT ALDYTH WOULD STILL BE WILLING TOSHARE HER INCOME WITH THEM BUT HOW STRAITENED THEIR MEANS WOULD BESHE SAW HERSELF AND DAUGHTERS LIVING IN A SMALL INCONVENIENT HOUSELIKE COMMON PEOPLE GLADYS PERHAPS IN HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY REDUCEDTO THE HUMILIATION OF TAKING A SITUATION. AND CECILWHAT WOULD BECOMEOF CECILS PROSPECTSIT IS NOT RIGHT IT IS NOT JUST SHE MURMURED FEELING THATARRANGEMENTS SO OPPOSED TO HER INTERESTS COULD NOT BUT BE WRONG. BUTMUST IT BE SO QUICKLY CAME THE TEMPTING THOUGHTNO ONE KNOWS OF ITBUT ME. MR. GREENWOOD DID NOT SEE IT. PERHAPS IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEENFOUND.WHAT A PITY SHE HAD BEEN SO CURIOUS TO EXAMINE THE OLD BUREAU AND YETIF SHE HAD NOT FOUND THIS WILL ANOTHER MIGHT HAVE DONE SO. QUICK CAMETHE THOUGHT I AM GLAD IT WAS NOT ALDYTH WHO FOUND IT.YET WHY WHAT WAS SHE GOING TO DO WITH IT NOW IT HAD COME TO LIGHTNOT TO PROCLAIM THE FACT AT ONCE CERTAINLY. SHOULD SHE THRUST IT BACKIN THE RECESS AND LEAVE IT FOR SOME ONE ELSE TO DISCOVER SHE SHRANKFROM THE IDEA. IT WOULD BE LIKE HAVING A DRAWN SWORD FOR EVER HANGINGABOVE HER HEAD. WHAT THEN DESTROY IT SHE TURNED HOT AND THEN COLD ASTHE EVIL SUGGESTION PRESENTED ITSELF. WAS IT NOT FELONY TO DESTROY AWILL THAT WAS A VERY UGLY WORD. SHE COULD NOT DO SUCH A THING AS THAT.AND YETSHE WISHED THE WILL WERE DESTROYED. SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOWTHAT IT WOULD NEVER HAVE POWER TO AFFECT HER WELFARE.ILLUSTRATIONSHE GLANCED AT IT AGAIN. THE NAMES OF THE WITNESSES WERE STRANGE TOHER. ONE HAD WRITTEN SOLICITOR AND A LONDON ADDRESS AFTER HIS NAME.WOULD HE BE LIKELY TO KNOW THAT THE WILL HAD NOT COME INTO OPERATIONWOULD IT BE SAFE TO DESTROY IT THE PERSPIRATION ROSE ON MRS. STANTONSFOREHEAD AS SHE ASKED HERSELF THIS QUESTION. SUDDENLY TO HERCONSTERNATION SHE HEARD VOICES CLOSE AT HAND IN THE GARDEN.IT WAS ALDYTH AND GLADYS. WHILST SHE HAD BEEN SEARCHING THE BUREAU THEAFTERNOON HAD WORN AWAY AND THEY HAD RETURNED FROM THEIR DRIVE.GLADYS WAS PLANNING A TENNISGROUND WHICH SHE WISHED TO PERSUADEALDYTH TO HAVE MADE BUT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MIGHT TURN THEIR STEPSTOWARDS THE OPEN WINDOW. IN AN AGONY OF FEAR MRS. STANTON THRUST THEWILL INTO HER POCKET. THAT RECEPTACLE WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO HIDE ITSHE MUST HOLD THE FOLDS OF HER GOWN TOGETHER IF SHE WOULD CONCEAL THEPACKET AS SHE ESCAPED TO HER ROOM.BUT FIRST THERE WERE THE DRAWERS TO PUSH BACK INTO THEIR PLACE ANDLOCK AND THE BUREAU TO CLOSE. MRS. STANTON DID IT ALL IN NERVOUS HASTEWITH TREMBLING HANDS. ONE DRAWER WOULD NOT LOCK AND SHE LEFT IT OPENIN HER ALARM AS SHE HEARD THE GIRLS STEPS APPROACHING. SHE HAD BUTTIME TO CLOSE HER GOWN ERE THE GIRLS WERE AT THE WINDOW.MAMMA YOU HERE CRIED ALDYTH IN SURPRISE AS SHE GLANCED IN AT THEWINDOW.YES DEAR YOU MAY WELL BE SURPRISED SAID MRS. STANTON FAINTLY.BUT ITHOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO LOOK THROUGH THE ROOMSANDAND MRS.ROGERS GAVE ME THE KEYSBUTBUT IT HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME.I AM SURE IT HAS SAID ALDYTH WONDERING TO SEE HOW PALE HER MOTHERWAS AND THE TREMULOUS WAY IN WHICH SHE SPOKE. YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITEDTILL I COULD COME WITH YOU. WHY YOUR HAND IS QUITE COLD. I CANNOTLEAVE YOU AGAIN IF YOU NOT TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF.NO DO NOT LEAVE ME AGAIN CRIED MRS. STANTON BEGINNING TO SOB. ITIS BETTER FOR ME TO HAVE YOU NEAR. I GET THINKING OF THINGS WHEN I AMALONE AND I CANNOT BEAR IT.DO NOT CRY DEAR MAMMA. I AM HERE. I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU SAID ALDYTHTHROWING HER ARMS ABOUT HER MOTHER. BUT YOU MUST NOT STAY IN THISCHILL ROOM. COME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM.NO NO LET ME GO TO MY OWN ROOM SAID MRS. STANTON RISING HERRIGHT HAND STILL HOLDING THE FOLDS OF HER GOWN.ALDYTH WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE HAND TO DRAW WITHIN HER ARM BUT MRS.STANTON WHEELED HASTILY ROUND. THE OTHER SIDE PLEASE DEAR I WANT TOHOLD UP MY DRESS WITH THIS HAND.SUPPORTED BY ALDYTH SHE MOVED SLOWLY FROM THE ROOM. GLADYS DID NOTIMMEDIATELY FOLLOW THEM. SHE HAD NOT BETRAYED ANY ANXIETY ON HERMOTHERS ACCOUNT. THERE WAS A SATIRICAL SMILE ON HER LIPS AS SHE SAIDTO HERSELF GLANCING ROUND THE LIBRARYIT WAS LIKE MAMMA TO MAKE AN INSPECTION OF THE HOUSE WHEN ALDYTH WASOUT OF THE WAY BUT I WONDER DID SHE CHANCE UPON A SKELETON ANYWHERETHAT SHE WAS SO UPSETMRS. STANTON HAVING GAINED HER BEDROOM SEEMED INDISPOSED FOR FURTHERSOOTHING AND ONLY ANXIOUS TO SEND ALDYTH AWAY.LEAVE ME TO MYSELF NOW DEAR SHE SAID SINKING ON TO A COUCH IN SUCHA WAY THAT HER POCKET WAS HIDDEN. I ONLY WANT QUIET I SHALL BE BETTERWHEN I HAVE RESTED AWHILE.ALDYTH DID NOT REFLECT THAT HER MOTHER HAD BEEN ENJOYING QUIET ALLTHE AFTERNOON. SHE TOO WAS GLAD TO SLIP AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM. BUTNO SOONER HAD ALDYTH LEFT HER THAN MRS. STANTON ROSE FROM THE SOFAAND HAVING LOCKED THE DOOR FOUND A TRAVELLING DESK WHICH WAS FITTEDWITH A GOOD PATENT LOCK. IN THIS SHE PLACED THE WILL AND HAVING LOCKEDTHE DESK PUT THE KEY AWAY IN A DRAWER WHICH SHE ALSO LOCKED THENMOUNTING ON A CHAIR SHE PUSHED THE DESK OUT OF SIGHT ON THE TOP SHELFOF HER WARDROBE.ANYHOW I WILL DO NOTHING IN THE MATTER TILL THE MAIL BRINGS ME NEWSSHE SAID TO HERSELF.CHAPTER XXVI.A FAREWELL.ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALDYTH FOUND HER MOTHER LOOKING WHITE ANDWORN. AND IN RESPONSE TO HER DAUGHTERS ANXIOUS QUESTIONING SHECONFESSED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY SLEPT AT ALL DURING THE NIGHT. YET SHEWAS NOT TO BE PERSUADED TO REST LONGER IN BED. SHE WAS EAGER TO RISEAND THROUGHOUT THE DAY SHE SHOWED A RESTLESSNESS AND IRRITABILITYWHICH WAS TRYING TO THOSE ABOUT HER BUT WAS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT INONE UPON WHOM SUCH HEAVY TROUBLE HAD FALLEN.IN THE AFTERNOON ALDYTH WHO HAD BEEN PACKING A HAMPER OF FLOWERS FORTHE BENEFIT OF HER GIRL FRIENDS AT WHITECHAPEL WISHED TO CONVEY IT TOTHE RAILWAY STATION. IT WAS A LOVELY AUTUMN AFTERNOON SO SHE PROPOSEDTHAT HER MOTHER AND GLADYS SHOULD ACCOMPANY HER FOR THE DRIVE ANDTHEY SHOULD MAKE A LONG ROUND TO WOODHAM WHERE SHE WOULD LEAVE THEMTO RETURN HOME IN THE CARE OF OLD JOHN AS SHE WISHED TO CALL AT HERAUNTS.BUT HOW WILL YOU GET HOME IF WE GO ON IN THE CARRIAGE ASKED GLADYS.OH I SHALL HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH AUNTIE AND THEN WALK HOME SAIDALDYTH.WALK EXCLAIMED GLADYS. ALL THAT LONG DULL ROADOH I SHALL NOT KEEP TO THE ROAD SAID ALDYTH. THERE IS A SHORTERWAY ACROSS SOME FIELDS. IT IS A PLEASANT WALK AND I SHALL ENJOY ITTHIS EVENING.WHAT ALL ALONE SAID GLADYS. I SHOULD BE SCARED TO WALK BY MYSELFIN THE COUNTRY.THAT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT USED TO THE COUNTRY SAID ALDYTH. I CANASSURE YOU THE OPEN FIELDS HAVE NO TERRORS FOR ME.BUT YOU WILL BE VERY TIRED SURELY IT WILL NOT BE WISE OF YOU TO DOSO ALDYTH SAID HER MOTHER FEELING MORE RELUCTANCE TO THE IDEA THANSHE COULD EASILY HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR.I AM NOT AFRAID OF FATIGUE SAID ALDYTH. I HAVE OFTEN WALKED HEREFROM WOODHAMSOMETIMES WITH GUY SOMETIMES BY MYSELF. YOU WILL SEE ISHALL COME IN AS FRESH AS A DAISY.ALDYTH HAD SET HER HEART UPON HAVING A TALK WITH HER AUNT AND SHE WASNOT DISPOSED TO LIGHTLY RELINQUISH HER PLAN.MRS. STANTON LOOKED ANNOYED AND TALKED ABOUT REMAINING AT HOMEHERSELF IN WHICH CASE ALDYTH WOULD HAVE FELT CONSTRAINED TO KEEP HERCOMPANY. BUT IN TRUTH MRS. STANTON WAS LONGING TO ESCAPE FOR A WHILEFROM THE HOUSE WHERE HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE HIDDEN WILL SEEMED ANINTOLERABLE OPPRESSION. NO DOUBT AFTER AWHILE THIS NERVOUS RESTLESSFEELING WOULD PASS AND SHE WOULD CEASE TO DREAD SELFBETRAYAL OR THATSTRANGE RELUCTANT IMPULSE TO CONFESSION WHICH CAME TO HER IN ALDYTHSPRESENCE. BUT WHILST SHE FELT THUS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT INACTIVEIN ROOMS IN WHICH SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SIT. THE LONG DRIVE OFFERED ARELIEF WHICH SHE COULD NOT REJECT SO SHE LET ALDYTH PERSUADE HER TOGET READY AND TOOK HER PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE WHILST ALDYTH ARRANGEDSOME CUSHIONS FOR HER COMFORT WITH MORE THAN EVER OF THE AIR OF ABANISHED QUEEN.IT WAS A PLEASANT DAY AND TO ALDYTH WHOSE HEART HAD A BURDEN WHICHNO ONE COULD SHARE THE CALM RESTFUL BEAUTY OF THE AUTUMN DAY WASSOOTHING. EVERY PEACEFUL COUNTRY SCENE ON WHICH HER EYES FELL HAD ITSPRECIOUSNESS FOR HER. HERE THE LAST LOAD OF A LATE HARVEST WAS BEINGLIFTED BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE STUBBLE FIELDS LAY WHITE AND BARESURROUNDED BY THE GREEN PASTURES HERE WAS A COTTAGE ORCHARD WITH ITSGNARLED TREES BOWING BENEATH A WEIGHT OF ROSY APPLES THERE WAS AN OLDMOSSGROWN WELL WITH ITS BUCKET AND PULLEY AND THERE A WOMAN WHOSEBEES HAD SWARMED IN A NEIGHBOURING ELDERTREE AND WHO WAS ENDEAVOURINGTO ATTRACT THEM TO A HIVE BY MEANS OF A JINGLING PERFORMANCE WITH A KEYAND A FRYINGPAN.THIS LAST SIGHT MADE GLADYS LAUGH BUT HER MOTHER LOOKED ON EVERYTHINGWITH A MELANCHOLY INDIFFERENT GAZE.HOW DREARY THIS FLAT LANDSCAPE IS SHE SAID ONCE. NOTHING TO BE SEENBUT FIELDS AND WINDMILLSALDYTH ALIGHTED AT THE RAILWAY STATION AND HAVING CONSIGNED HER HAMPERTO THE CARE OF THE STATIONMASTER WALKED UP THE TOWN TOWARDS HERAUNTS COTTAGE. BUT AS SHE APPROACHED THE BLANDS HOUSE MRS. BLANDSMILED AND BECKONED TO HER FROM THE BOWWINDOW AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLETO PASS WITHOUT A WORD. THE HOUSE DOOR COULD ALWAYS BE OPENED FROM THEOUTSIDE. ALDYTH OPENED IT AND STEPPED IN WITHOUT CEREMONY.ALL ALONE SHE SAID AS SHE KISSED HER OLD FRIEND HOW STRANGE YOUMUST FEEL WITHOUT ONE OF THE GIRLSYES INDEED SAID MRS. BLAND. GWEN THOUGHT I OUGHT TO KEEP HER HOMEFOR HALF A TERM TO BEAR ME COMPANY AND DEEMED ME A HARDHEARTEDPARENT BECAUSE I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER SUGGESTION. BUT I DO NOTAPPROVE OF BROKEN WORK.AND WHAT NEWS OF THE OTHERS ASKED ALDYTH.OH FAIRLY GOOD SAID MRS. BLAND. KITTY SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HERSELFVERY MUCH AND SHE SAYS HILDA IS A LITTLE BRIGHTER. THEY ARE AT DINAN.WHEN THEY WROTE THEY HAD BEEN TO SEE THE RUINED CASTLE IN WHICH THELADY OF LA GARRAYE LIVED. KITTY HAS BEEN READING THE POEM AND SEEMSMUCH IMPRESSED BY IT. I WAS SURPRISED AT THE WAY IN WHICH SHE WROTE. ITWAS AS IF KITTY AND HILDA HAD CHANGED PLACES. HILDA SAYS LITTLE IN HERLETTERS POOR CHILD. I FANCY SHE WOULD BE SORRY FOR ME TO THINK SHE WASAT ALL MORE CHEERFUL. IF I CAN FIND KITTYS LETTER YOU SHALL READ IT.MRS. BLAND ROSE TO HUNT FOR KITTYS LETTER AMIDST THE PAPERS ON HERWRITINGTABLE. AT THAT MOMENT ALDYTH SEATED BY THE WINDOW SAW JOHNGLYNNE WALK DOWN THE STREET. THE GIRL WAS THANKFUL MRS. BLANDS BACKWAS TURNED AS SHE FELT THE COLOUR RUSH INTO HER FACE. THAT SUDDENTHRILL WAS FOLLOWED BY A DEEP SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DEPRESSION.HE WAS GONE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT SHE WAS TAKING THERE WASNO LIKELIHOOD OF HER SEEING HIM AND IN A DAY OR TWO AT THE LATEST HEWOULD LEAVE WOODHAM.MRS. BLAND FAILED TO FIND KITTYS LETTER AND ALDYTH LEFT WITHOUTSEEING IT. IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS AT HER AUNTS. MISS LORRAINEWELCOMED HER WITH A LITTLE AIR OF EXCITEMENT.WHAT A PITY YOU DID NOT COME A FEW MINUTES EARLIER SHE SAID. MR.GLYNNE WAS HERE. HE ASKED AFTER YOU. I THINK HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SAYGOODBYE TO YOU.ALDYTH GREW WHITE. SHE COULD SAY NOTHING UNDER THE GRASP OFDISAPPOINTMENT. FATE WAS HARD UPON HER. IF SHE HAD NOT SEEN MRS. BLANDAT THE WINDOW AND GONE INTO HER HOUSE SHE WOULD HAVE ARRIVED IN TIMETO GREET JOHN GLYNNE. AND IT SEEMED TO ALDYTH AT THAT MOMENT THAT ITWOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A GREAT DEAL JUST TO HAVE SAID GOODBYE TO HIM.IF MISS LORRAINE NOTED THE QUICK CHANGE OF ALDYTHS EXPRESSION SHE DIDNOT APPEAR TO DO SO. SHE CHATTED ON WITH HER USUAL VOLUBILITY. THEREARE TIMES WHEN IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE A COMPANION WITH A FACULTY OFSMALL TALK. SUCH A ONE IS SATISFIED WITH THE LEAST MODICUM IN THE WAYOF RESPONSE.I CAN SEE THAT MR. GLYNNE FEELS LEAVING WOODHAM SAID MISS LORRAINE.HE SAID HE COULD HARDLY EXPECT TO MEET WITH SUCH KIND FRIENDS ANYWHEREELSE. INDEED I DO NOT THINK HE LIKES LEAVING ENGLAND AT ALL BUT ITIS FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MOTHER HE HAS ACCEPTED THE APPOINTMENT. IT WILLMAKE THINGS EASIER FOR HER HE SAYS AND SHE HAS NOT BEEN AT ALL STRONGLATELY. I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW HOW SHE WILL BEAR PARTING WITH HIM BUTTHERE IS ANOTHER BROTHER YOU KNOW WHO WILL BE AT HOME TO TAKE CARE OFHER.YES SAID ALDYTH FAINTLY AS HER AUNT LOOKED TOWARDS HER.MR. GLYNNE IS VERY FOND OF HIS MOTHER CONTINUED MISS LORRAINE. IFI WERE NOT ALREADY CONVINCED OF IT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HE WAS A GOODMAN BY THE WAY IN WHICH HE SPOKE OF HIS MOTHER THIS AFTERNOON.WHEN DOES HE LEAVE ASKED ALDYTH AS HER AUNT PAUSED TO TAKE BREATH.LEAVE WOODHAM TOMORROW MORNING AND HE SAILS AT THE END OF THE WEEK.BUT ALDYTH IF YOU ARE TO WALK HOME BEFORE IT GETS DARK WE MUST HAVETEA AT ONCE.AND MISS LORRAINE SUMMONED THE LITTLE HOUSEMAID BY A VIGOROUS PULL OFTHE BELL.IN HALF AN HOUR ALDYTH WAS ON HER WAY HOME. SHE WAS ONE TO ENJOY ALONG BRISK WALK BUT NOW HER SWEET CALM FACE HAD A WEARY LOOK ANDHER STEP WAS LESS ELASTIC THAN USUAL. SHE HAD STARTED FORTH A FEWHOURS EARLIER WITH NO DEFINITE HOPE IN HER HEART BUT SHE WAS BEARINGBACK WITH HER AN UNMISTAKABLE WEIGHT OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN. SHEDID NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE HER FEELINGS SHE DID NOT OWN TO HERSELFTHAT MIGHTY LOVE HAD LAID HIS SPELL UPON HERLOVE AT WHICH SHE HADLAUGHEDWHICH HAD SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN HALF A FOLLY AS SHE HAD SEENIT INFLUENCING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER. SHE ONLY KNEW THAT A SHADOW HADFALLEN ON HER HEART THAT SOME SCARCEDEFINED HOPE HAD DIED AND THATLIFE HAD LOST THE BRIGHTNESS IT WORE FOR HER A LITTLE WHILE AGO.SHE HAD PASSED OUT OF THE ROAD AND WAS PURSUING HER WAY THROUGH ADEEP GRASSY MEADOW BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM WITH ROUND BUSHY POLLARDSGROWING ON ITS BANKS. BEHIND HER LAY THE LITTLE TOWN ITS RED ROOFSOLD CHURCH TOWER AND THE BROAD STRETCH OF WATER DOTTED WITH SAILSFORMING A FAIR PICTURE IN THE CLEAR EVENING LIGHT. NO SOUND BROKE THESTILLNESS SAVE THE SCARCE PERCEPTIBLE RIPPLE OF THE STREAM AND THEOCCASIONAL HOARSE CROAKING OF A FROG. THE PEACE THE SOLITUDE WASWELCOME TO ALDYTH.BUT AS SHE STEPPED ROUND THE TRUNK OF A LARGE ASHTREE THAT MADEA BREAK IN THE PATH SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS NOT ALONE IN HERENJOYMENT OF THE PLACE AND THE HOUR. ON THE RUDE STILE BEFORE HER WITHA BOOK ON HIS KNEE WHICH HE WAS NOT READING SAT JOHN GLYNNE.IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH WAS THE MORE SURPRISED. ALDYTH WASCONSCIOUS OF AN AGITATION WHICH SHE COULD NOT AT ONCE CONTROL. SHE FELTTHAT SHE WAS BLUSHING AND TREMBLING AS HE SPRANG DOWN AND ADVANCEDTO MEET HER. BUT SHE SAW A BRIGHT LOOK OF PLEASURE IN HIS EYES AS HESMILED ON HER AND SAID WITH ALL THE OLD FRIENDLINESSMISS ALDYTH I AM GLAD I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE TO LEAVE WOODHAMWITHOUT SEEING YOU AGAIN.THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY FAULT MR. GLYNNE SHE COULD NOT HELPSAYING. WYNDHAM IS NOT AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM WOODHAM AS TO MAKE ITIMPOSSIBLE TO VISIT A FRIEND WHO LIVES THERE. PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOWIT BUT YOU ARE ALMOST HALFWAY TO WYNDHAM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT.I KNOW HE SAID WITH A SMILE. WELL I DESERVE THAT REPROACH BUTINDEED I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I HAD ANY RIGHT TO CALL ON YOUIN YOUR NEW HOME.ANY RIGHT REPEATED ALDYTH BITING HER LIPS TO HIDE THEIR TREMBLING.THAT IS AN UNKIND THING TO SAY. WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT I MUST FORFEITYOUR FRIENDSHIPIT GLANCED THROUGH HER MIND THAT PERHAPS HE BLAMED HER FOR SUPPLANTINGGUY AT WYNDHAM. IF ONLY HE COULD KNOW WHAT IT HAD COST HER TO DO SOMUST THE LOSS OF HIS FRIENDSHIP BE PART OF THE PRICENOTHING. HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE THAT I WOULD WILLINGLY GIVE UP YOURFRIENDSHIP HE SAID. BUT THERE WERE REASONS WHY IT SEEMED TO ME THATI SHOULD NOT SEEK YOU UNDER YOUR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.WHAT HAVE MY CIRCUMSTANCES TO DO WITH IT ASKED ALDYTH ALMOSTIMPATIENTLY. DO YOU THINK SO POORLY OF ME AS TO IMAGINE THAT I MUSTCHANGE WITH MY CIRCUMSTANCESI AM FAR INDEED FROM THINKING POORLY OF YOU HE SAID QUIETLY.THEN WHY ASKED ALDYTH IMPETUOUSLY WHY DID YOU HOLD ALOOF FROM MEBECAUSE I HAD INHERITED WYNDHAM DOES THAT MAKE ME ANY DIFFERENT FROMWHAT I WAS BEFORE AM I NOT THE SAME GIRL I WAS WHEN FIRST YOU KNEW MENO HE SAID SLOWLY YOU ARE NOT THE SAME TO ME AS WHEN FIRST I SAWYOU.ALDYTH LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDER. SHE COULD NOT READ HIS GRAVE SET LOOK.WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE ASKED IN FALTERING TONES. HOW HAVE I ALTEREDDO YOU THINK I AM ELATED AT MY NEW POSITION OH YOU MISTAKE ME INDEEDIF YOU THINK SO IT HAS BROUGHT ME NO HAPPINESS. I NEVER NEEDED A TRUEFRIEND MORE THAN I DO NOW. BUT EVERY ONE DISAPPOINTS ME.HER LAST WORDS DEALT A WOUND TO GLYNNE. IT COST HIM AN EFFORT TO REPLYCALMLY.NOW YOU ARE MISTAKING ME HE SAID. WHEN I SAID THAT YOU WERE NOTTHE SAME TO ME I DID NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAD CHANGEDFAR LESS THAT YOUWERE NOT WORTHY THE HIGHEST REVERENCE MAN CAN PAY WOMAN. IT IS MYFEELING THAT HAS BECOMEIT IS BECAUSEHIS TONES HAD GROWN UNSTEADY. HE CHECKED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY. GLANCING ATHIM ALDYTH SAW WITH ALARM THAT HE HAD GROWN PALE AND WAS UNDER THEINFLUENCE OF SOME EMOTION WHICH MADE SELFCONTROL DIFFICULT.YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HE CONTINUED AFTER A MOMENT FINDING HISWORDS WITH DIFFICULTY AND HOW CAN I EXPLAIN OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVEMADE A CONVENTIONAL CALL ON YOU LIKE ANY ORDINARY ACQUAINTANCE.DOUBTLESS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO REPROACH ME FOR A BREACH OF COURTESY BUTI SHRANK FROM ITYOU WERE MORE TO ME. AND YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THOUGHNO CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES CAN AFFECT YOU IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THEMINDS OF OTHERS IT MAKES PEOPLE JUDGE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.AS HE SPOKE IN BROKEN HESITATING FASHION THERE DAWNED ON ALDYTH APERCEPTION OF HIS MEANING. HER FACE GREW CRIMSON THEN WHITE. SHE WOULDHAVE SPOKEN BUT WHAT COULD SHE SAY WORDS CAME TO HER LIPS BUT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER THEM. QUICK THOUGHTS VISIONS OF HER MOTHER HERSISTERS PASSED BEFORE HER MIND. SHE FELT LIKE ONE BOUND AND FETTERED.IT SEEMED LONG BUT IT WAS BUT A FEW MOMENTS THAT THEY STOOD INSILENCE THE WORDS THAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN VIBRATING IN THE CONSCIOUSNESSOF EACH. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM NOW BUT THE WORDSHE HAD UTTERED WERE FOLLOWED BY NONE OF SIMILAR PURPORT. HE ROUSEDHIMSELF AND SAID WITH AN ABRUPT CHANGE OF MANNERI MUST NOT DETAIN YOU LONGER. WILL YOU LET ME WALK WITH YOU THE RESTOF THE WAYALDYTH MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT AND THEY PASSED ON INTO THE NEXT FIELD.SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE TOLD WHETHER SHE WERE HAPPY OR WRETCHED. THEREWAS A STRANGE MINGLING OF SENSATIONS WITHIN HER AND SHE HAD BUTA CONFUSED APPREHENSION OF THE REMARKS HE WAS MAKING OR THE GREENMEADOWPATH FOLLOWED. NOW A BRAMBLE CAUGHT HER DRESS AND HE STOOPED TODETACH IT NOW HE GATHERED FOR HER A CLUSTER OF CRIMSON BERRIES FROMTHE MOUNTAIN ASH AND NOW SOME YELLOW MARGUERITES WHILST THEY TALKEDAS BEST THEY COULD ON ORDINARY TOPICS. BUT PRESENTLY THIS PRETENCE ATCONVERSATION FAILED AND THE LAST FIELD WAS CROSSED IN SILENCE.YOU WILL COME IN AND SEE MY MOTHER AND GLADYS SAID ALDYTH AS HEHALTED AT THE GATE OF WYNDHAM.I MUST ASK YOU TO EXCUSE ME TONIGHT HE SAID. I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKEYOUR MOTHERS ACQUAINTANCE BUT NOT TONIGHT. IT PLEASES ME TO THINKTHAT YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHER WITH YOU NOW. YOUR LONGDEFERRED HOPE ISFULFILLED AT LAST.YES AT LAST SAID ALDYTH.YOU WILL BE HAPPYI PRAY GOD YOU MAY BE HAPPY HE SAID FERVENTLY.AND NOW I MUST BID YOU GOODBYETILL WE MEET AGAIN.YOU ARE GOING AWAYSO FAR FALTERED ALDYTH I SHALL NEVER SEE YOUAGAIN.DO NOT SAY NEVER I CANNOT BEAR THAT WORD HE REPLIED. SOME DAYIFI LIVEI SHALL COME BACK. DO NOT MAKE THINGS HARDER FOR ME. YOU CANNOTKNOW HOW STERN THE DUTY SEEMS THAT BIDS ME GO.DUTY SEEMS STERN TO ME TOO ALDYTH SAID WITH A QUIVER IN HER VOICEWHILST TEARS DIMMED HER VISION.SHE COULD NOT UTTER A GOODBYE BUT SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND. HE HELD ITIN HIS FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEN RELEASED IT AND TURNED AWAY WITHOUTANOTHER WORD. SHE COULD NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT. SHE STOOD GAZING AFTERHIM TILL HIS FIGURE GREW INDISTINCT IN THE GATHERING GLOOM. SHE COULDJUST SEE THAT HE TURNED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE END OF THE PATH. SHEWAVED HER HAND. COULD HE SEE THE MOVEMENT PROBABLY NOT FOR THE NEXTINSTANT HE WAS GONE AND ONLY THE CREEPING GREY MIST MET HER GAZE.SHE MOVED ON WITH SLOW HEAVY STEP AND BEFORE HER IN DIM OUTLINEWITH THE GREY MIST GATHERING ABOUT IT STOOD WYNDHAM HALL.HER INHERITANCEHER HOME BUT THERE WAS NO JOY IN THE THOUGHT. REGRETFILLED HER HEART STIRRED BY A VISION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.OH SHE SIGHED TO HERSELF HOW I WISH UNCLE HAD MADE ANOTHERWILLHOW I WISH IT WERE NOT MINEBUT QUICKLY FOLLOWED THE REFLECTION THAT IN THAT CASE THINGS WOULDHAVE BEEN HARDER FOR HER MOTHER. SHE COULD NOT WHOLLY REGRET THAT WHICHGAVE HER SUCH POWER TO COMFORT AND CHERISH HER MOTHER.CHAPTER XXVII.AN ACCIDENT IN THE HUNTINGFIELD.IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT MRS. STANTON SHOULD SEEM SORELY DEPRESSEDAFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIL FROM AUSTRALIA. THE NEWS IT BROUGHT WASOF THE WORST. THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE LARGE MERCANTILE HOUSE WAS UTTERNOTHING COULD BE SAVED FROM THE WRECK FOR THE WIDOW AND CHILDREN OF THESENIOR PARTNER. THEY MIGHT CONSOLE THEMSELVES WITH THE THOUGHT THATTHEY WERE NOT THE ONLY SUFFERERS. UPON EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH THEBUSINESS LOSS HAD FALLEN AND IN MOST CASES IT MEANT RUIN.IT WAS EASY TO FIND CAUSE FOR BLAME AND PUBLIC OPINION DID NOT SPARETHE PRINCIPALS. MRS. STANTON MIGHT COUNT IT A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCETHAT THE BROAD SEAS NOW SEPARATED HER FROM THE SOCIAL CIRCLE ATMELBOURNE WHICH HAD FORMERLY COURTED AND FLATTERED HER.ALDYTH COULD NOT WONDER THAT HER MOTHER SHED MANY TEARS OVER THELETTERS WHICH TOLD ALL THAT COULD BE TOLD OF HER HUSBANDS LAST HOURSAND GAVE PARTICULARS OF THE INTERMENT. SHE COULD COMPREHEND HERMOTHERS NERVOUSNESS AND IRRITABILITY THE EVIDENCE OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTSAND WEARING EMOTIONS. BUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE AVERSION HERMOTHER SEEMED TO HAVE CONCEIVED FOR GUY LORRAINE.THAT GENTLEMAN MADE HIS CALL AT THE HALL NOT LONG AFTER HISINTRODUCTION TO GLADYS. ON THE FIRST OCCASION MRS. STANTON DECLINED TOSEE HIM BUT GUY CONSIDERING HIMSELF ONE OF THE FAMILY CAME AGAIN ANDAGAIN BENT ON MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE AND EAGER TO BE OF SERVICE TOTHE NEW RESIDENTS SO THAT IT WAS NOT EASY FOR MRS. STANTON TO AVOIDHIM. SHE SAT ON THORNS WHILST HE WAS PRESENT AND HIS DEPARTURE WAS THESIGNAL FOR AN OUTBREAK OF BITTER COMMENTS ON HIS DULNESS AWKWARDNESSAND GENERAL LACK OF SOCIAL GRACES. YET SHE ALWAYS MAINTAINED AN OUTWARDSHOW OF CORDIALITY TOWARDS HIM. INDEED IT SEEMED TO ALDYTH THAT HERMOTHER WAS ESPECIALLY CAREFUL TO FAIL IN NO COURTESY WITH REGARD TOGUY AND SHE INTERPRETED THIS AS A SIGN THAT HER MOTHER SHARED HERREGRETFUL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LOSS HER INHERITANCE HAD INVOLVED FORGUY.GLADYS WAS READY ENOUGH TO RAISE A LAUGH AT GUYS EXPENSE YET HISVISITS WERE NOT DISAGREEABLE TO HER. IT PLEASED HER TO PLAY OFF UPONHIM HER MOST FASCINATING AIRS WITH A RESULT HIGHLY GRATIFYING TO HERVANITY. HE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH ADMIRATION AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF HERAND HE READILY SUCCUMBED TO HER FASCINATIONS. ERE HILDA BLAND RETURNEDTO HER HOME HE WAS UTTERLY HOPELESSLY ENSLAVED BY HIS NEW CHARMER.THE FIRE KINDLED WITHIN HIM WAS AS ALDYTH WAS QUICK TO PERCEIVE NOSPURIOUS FLAME. HE WAS GENUINELY IN LOVE AT LAST AND ALDYTH COULDALMOST PITY HIM LITTLE AS HE DESERVED PITY FOR SHE SAW NO HOPE OF HISWOOING SUCCESSFULLY. IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT MRS. STANTON WOULDALLOW HER PRETTY GLADYS TO WED A MERE FARMER.YET MRS. STANTON DID NOT DISCOURAGE THE INTIMACY TO THE EXTENTALDYTH EXPECTED. SHE WAS FRETFUL WITH HER DAUGHTER WHEN SHE SHOWED APREFERENCE FOR GUYS SOCIETY BUT SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO PREVENTTHEIR MEETING. GLADYS WOULD HAVE FOUND HER DAYS DULL AT WYNDHAM BUT FORHIS FREQUENT VISITS.THERE WERE FEW OTHER VISITORS DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIRBEREAVEMENT. MR. GREENWOOD AND HIS BROTHER THE SOLICITOR CAMEPRETTY FREQUENTLY AND WERE WELCOME GUESTS ALTHOUGH THEIR VISITS WEREOSTENSIBLY ON BUSINESS. THE BANKERS LARGE HOUSE IN THE HIGH STREETSEEMED GRIEVOUSLY LARGE AND VACANT TO HIM WITHOUT THE WIFE WHO HAD MADEIT SO CHEERFUL A HOME. ALDYTH WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HIM AND HEWAS PERHAPS GLAD THAT HIS OFFICE OF EXECUTOR TO STEPHEN LORRAINESWILL AFFORDED HIM MANY PRETEXTS FOR VISITING HER AT WYNDHAM. THEEVENINGS SPENT IN HER PRETTY DRAWING ROOM WITH THREE CHARMING WOMENEXERTING THEMSELVES FOR HIS ENTERTAINMENT WERE A PLEASANT CONTRAST TOTHOSE HE PASSED IN DREARINESS AT HOME.THE RIDES WHICH GLADYS TOOK ALMOST DAILY WERE HER CHIEF SOURCE OFPLEASURE IN THIS QUIET SEASON. DEARLY AS SHE LOVED THE EXERCISEALDYTH COULD SELDOM ACCOMPANY HER FOR HER MOTHER SHRINKING MORE ANDMORE FROM BEING LEFT TO HER OWN THOUGHTS CONSTANTLY REQUIRED HERCOMPANIONSHIP. ALDYTH WAS CONTENT TO FOREGO HER OWN PLEASURE IT WAS SOSWEET TO FEEL THAT HER MOTHER NEEDED HER.MEANWHILE THE PRETTY FORM OF GLADYS MOUNTED ON PANSYSHE NEARLY ALWAYSRODE PANSYWITH A GROOM FOLLOWING ON ANOTHER HORSE BECAME A FAMILIARSIGHT AT WOODHAM FOR SHE LOVED THE SLIGHT SENSATION SHE CREATED WHENSHE RODE DOWN THE HIGH STREET. NOT SELDOM SHE RETURNED FROM HER RIDEACCOMPANIED BY GUY WHO WAS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR A CHANCE OF MEETINGHER. IT VEXED MRS. STANTON TO SEE HER RETURN SO ESCORTED BUT IF SHEGAVE EXPRESSION TO HER ANNOYANCE GLADYS ONLY LAUGHED AND TOLD HERMOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT.I DO NOT THINK I AM EXACTLY THE ONE TO WED A COUNTRY BUMPKIN SHESAID ONE DAY. IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT WOULD IT NOT MAMMA IF HE HADBEEN THE HEIR TO WYNDHAMIT WAS AN AIMLESS SHAFT OF SATIRE BUT IT FOUND A MARK OF WHICH SHELITTLE GUESSED. HER MOTHERS FACE BLANCHED A SPASM AS OF POSITIVE PAINPASSED OVER IT. GLADYS SAW AND WONDERED. WHAT HAD SHE SAID SURELYNOTHING WORSE THAN MANY OF HER CARELESS SPEECHESIT IS NOT FAIR TO CALL GUY A BUMPKIN SAID ALDYTH WHO WAS PRESENT.PERHAPS NOT REPLIED GLADYS BUT HE IS A FARMER IS HE NOT CAN YOUFANCY ME A FARMERS WIFE WITH MY SLEEVES TURNED UP MAKING BUTTERNO I CANNOT SAID ALDYTH AND LAUGHEDIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKEGLADYS SERIOUSLYBUT I DO NOT THINK GUY WILL EXPECT HIS WIFE TO MAKETHE BUTTER THERE ARE FEW FARMERS WIVES WHO DO THAT NOWADAYS.MRS. STANTON BREATHED MORE FREELY AS SHE HEARD THEIR LIGHT TALK. HADSHE BETRAYED HERSELF NO THEY COULD NEVER SUSPECT IT BUT THE TERRIBLEPRESSURE OF HER SECRET AT TIMES IT WAS INSUPPORTABLE.CHRISTMAS WAS WITHIN HAIL ERE KITTY AND HILDA BLAND CAME HOME. AFTERTHEIR RETURN FROM THE CONTINENT THEY HAD MADE A LONG STAY IN LONDON.HILDAS HEALTH AND SPIRITS HAD REVIVED SOMEWHAT AMIDST FRESH SCENES ANDACQUAINTANCES BUT THE COMING BACK WAS A TRIAL TO HER AND SHE WOULDNOT NERVE HERSELF TO BEAR IT BRAVELY. IT WOULD BE HARD TO FACE HERLITTLE WORLD AGAIN AND HERS WAS A NATURE THAT SEEKS TO AVOID HARDSHIP.OH ALDYTH I CANNOT LIVE HERE SHE CRIED WHEN FIRST THEY MET.WOODHAM IS HATEFUL TO ME NOW. DO TRY IF YOU CAN PERSUADE MOTHER THAT ISHOULD BE BETTER AWAY. IF ONLY SHE WOULD LET ME BE TRAINED AS A NURSEWOULD YOU REALLY LIKE THAT ALDYTH ASKED.AS MUCH AS I COULD LIKE ANYTHING IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO DO.YOU WOULD FIND IT VERY HARD WORK I FEAR. HILDA I HAVE AN IDEA IN MYHEAD OF SOME WORK IN WHICH YOU MIGHT HELP ME.WHAT IS IT HILDA ASKED WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST.THERE IS A COTTAGE HALF A MILE FROM WYNDHAM ON THE EDGE OF THECOMMON. A GAMEKEEPER USED TO LIVE IN IT BUT IT HAS BEEN EMPTY SOMETIME. THERE ARE THREE GOOD ROOMS BELOW AND ABOVE. I AM THINKING OFPUTTING IT IN THOROUGH REPAIR AND CONVERTING IT INTO A COUNTRY HOMEFOR MY FACTORY GIRLS. IT WOULD DO SOME OF THOSE POOR OVERWORKED GIRLSSO MUCH GOOD TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS IN THE COUNTRY. I CAN RELY ON MRS.WHEATLEY TO FIND OUT THOSE WHO MOST NEED IT AND SEND THEM DOWN TO ME.NOW DO YOU NOT THINK IT A GOOD IDEAYES IT IS SAID HILDA WITHOUT HOWEVER MANIFESTING ANY ENTHUSIASM.I SHALL HAVE TO FIND A GOOD MOTHERLY WOMAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEHOME SAID ALDYTH TOO FULL OF THE MATTER TO BE CHILLED BY HILDAS LACKOF INTEREST. OF COURSE I CANNOT OPEN IT TILL THE SPRING BUT ONCESTARTED I SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GUESTS THERE NEARLY ALLTHE YEAR ROUND. THERE IS A PRETTY LITTLE GARDEN BEFORE THE HOUSE ANDGROUND ENOUGH BEHIND TO GROW ALL THE VEGETABLES THAT WILL BE NEEDED.ALDYTH CHECKED HERSELF SHE BECAME AWARE THAT HILDA WAS PAYING NO HEEDTO WHAT SHE SAID. THEY WERE SEATED IN THE BOWWINDOW OF MRS. BLANDSDRAWING ROOM AND HILDAS ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY TWO RIDERS WHO WEREPASSING THE HOUSE. THE PAINFUL FLUSH WHICH HAD RISEN IN HILDAS FACEPROCLAIMED THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE GENTLEMAN.WHO IS THAT WITH HIM SHE ASKED IN A HURRIED WHISPER.GLADYS MY SISTER ALDYTH SAID.OH ALDYTH WHAT DOES IT MEAN POOR HILDA ASKED.DONT DISTRESS YOURSELF REPLIED ALDYTH. THEIR BEING TOGETHER HASNO PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE ONLY I WILL NOT DISGUISE FROM YOU THATGLADYSS SOCIETY HAS A STRONG ATTRACTION FOR GUY.HILDA BURST INTO TEARS.OH ALDYTH AND YOU WOULD HAVE ME STAY AT WOODHAMAFTER THAT IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT HILDA ABANDONED HERSELF AFRESHTO MELANCHOLY SANK BACK INTO A SEMIINVALID STATE RESOLUTELY REFUSEDALL INVITATIONS AND IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TRIED THE PATIENCE OF HERMOTHER AND KITTY.IT WAS A PLEASURE TO ALDYTH TO WELCOME NELLY AND CECIL ALSO FOR A FEWDAYS TO HER HOME AT CHRISTMAS.GWENDOLEN BLAND TOO WAS AT HOME AND DESPITE THE DISTANCE OF WYNDHAMHALL FROM WOODHAM SHE AND KITTY WERE OFTEN WITH ALDYTH AND HERSISTERS. THE GIRLS MADE A LIVELY PARTY TOGETHER. GLADYS AND KITTYTOOK TO EACH OTHER AND BECAME GOOD FRIENDS. THEY OFTEN RODE TOGETHERDISPENSING WITH THE ATTENDANCE OF THE GROOM WHICH MRS. STANTONINSISTED UPON WHEN GLADYS RODE ALONE.MRS. STANTON WAS WELL PLEASED THAT KITTY SHOULD BE GLADYSS COMPANIONFOR KITTY HELD HERSELF HAUGHTILY ALOOF FROM GUY LORRAINE RESENTING HISCONDUCT TOWARDS HER SISTER SO THAT DESPITE HIS SANGFROID HE COULDHARDLY THRUST HIS COMPANY UPON HER.THE HUNTING SEASON BROUGHT THE GIRLS A NEW EXCITEMENT. GLADYS WAS ANACCOMPLISHED AND FEARLESS RIDER AND KITTY NOT A WHIT BEHIND HER INDARING. THEY SET THEIR HEARTS UPON FOLLOWING THE HOUNDS.MRS. STANTON EXPRESSED SOME DISAPPROVAL BUT DID NOT FORBID GLADYS TOHUNT PERHAPS BEING DOUBTFUL OF HER POWER TO RESTRAIN HER DAUGHTER FROMDOING AS SHE WISHED.MRS. BLANDS CONSENT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO WIN. SHE HAD A NERVOUS DREADOF ACCIDENT AND AT FIRST WOULD NOT HEAR OF SUCH A THING. BUT IN A WEAKHOUR THE COMBINED PERSUASIONS OF GLADYS AND KITTY OVERCAME HER BETTERJUDGMENT. SHE WAS INDUCED TO CONSENT FOR JUST THIS ONCE AND AFTERTHAT KITTY CONTRIVED TO FOLLOW THE HOUNDS AS OFTEN AS SHE DESIRED. THETWO YOUNG LADIES GLADYS CHARMINGLY EQUIPPED AND FASCINATING ALL THEGENTLEMEN WITH HER GRACE AND SPIRIT WERE TO BE SEEN AT MOST OF THEMEETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.ADMIRING COMMENTS ON THEIR RIDING REACHED THE EARS OF THEIR MOTHERSAND EVEN MRS. BLAND FELT SOME PRIDE FOR WHICH SHE AFTERWARDS BITTERLYREPROACHED HERSELF IN HER DAUGHTERS BOLD HORSEMANSHIP. SHE CEASED TOFEEL MUCH FEAR REMEMBERING HOW WELL THE GIRLS RODE AND THAT THEY HADPROMISED TO DO NOTHING RASH.THIS IS THE LAST TIME MOTHER REALLY THE LAST TIME CRIED KITTYBLAND ONE BRIGHT MORNING IN FEBRUARY AS SHE CAME DOWN STAIRS IN HERRIDING HABIT AND HAT AND MET HER MOTHERS REPROVING SHAKE OF THE HEAD.HER WORDS WERE TRUER THAN SHE KNEW.THE SUN WAS SHINING IN AT THE BAY WINDOW BUT THE AIR OUTSIDE WAS SHARPWITH FROST AND HILDA WITH A WOOLLEN SHAWL ABOUT HER SHOULDERS WASHANGING OVER THE FIRE. A WARM COLOUR GLOWED IN KITTYS FACE. THE COLDONLY EXHILARATED HER. SHE LOOKED SO FRESH AND STRONG AND GLAD AS SHESTOOD AT THE WINDOW IMPATIENTLY FLOURISHING HER WHIP EAGER TO BE INTHE SADDLE AND OFF.I WISH YOU WOULD SHUT THE DOOR SAID HILDA IN A PETTISH TONE. YOUNEVER THINK THAT ANY ONE ELSE IS IN THE ROOM.ALL RIGHT HERES GLADYS. IM OFF NOW CRIED KITTY. GOODBYEHILDA HARDLY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO RESPOND. SHE HAD RISEN IN A MISERABLEHUMOUR BUT HAD ANYTHING BEEN NEEDED TO COMPLETE HER DISSATISFACTIONTHE MENTION OF GLADYS WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. IT ANNOYED HER TO HEARTHE GIRLS MERRY TONES GREETING MRS. BLAND WHO STOOD AT THE DOOR TOWATCH KITTY MOUNT.WE SHALL HAVE A LOVELY RUN THE DAY IS PERFECT GLADYS SAID.A BURST OF MERRY LAUGHTER FOLLOWED SOME REMARK OF MRS. BLANDS ANDTHEN THE GIRLS MOVED OFF. HILDA SAW THEM PASS THE WINDOW FOR THEMEET TODAY WAS AT AN OLD MANOR FORM DOWN THE HUNDREDS. A LOW MOANESCAPED HER.SOME GIRLS HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEART CAN WISH SHE SAID TO HERSELF.IT IS GOOD TO BE KITTY. SHE IS FOR EVER OFF TO SOME PLEASURE OR OTHER.SHE HAS NEVER KNOWN A TROUBLE IF SHE HAD SHE MIGHT UNDERSTAND MYFEELINGS.ERE THE DAY WAS OVER HILDA RECALLED THESE THOUGHTS WITH BITTER PAIN.A TERRIBLE SHOCK ROUSED HER FROM HER SELFABSORPTION FOR THREE HOURSLATER KITTY WAS CARRIED INSENSIBLE ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HER HOME.HER HORSE HAD FALLEN WITH HER AND SHE WAS SERIOUSLY INJUREDHOWSERIOUSLY COULD NOT YET BE ASCERTAINED BUT HER CONDITION WAS SUCH ASGAVE RISE TO THE WORST FEARS.ALDYTH LEARNED THE NEWS AN HOUR LATER WHEN GLADYS WHITE ANDSHIVERING CAME HOME ATTENDED BY GUY WHO HAD BEEN AT HAND WHEN THEACCIDENT HAPPENED AND HAD RENDERED ALL THE SERVICE IN HIS POWER.GLADYS WAS TOO SHOCKED AND CONFUSED TO GIVE A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF WHATHAD HAPPENED. I ONLY KNOW THAT THE HOUNDS WERE IN FULL CRY AND WEWERE TEARING AFTER THEM. I SAW A FENCEIT WAS NOT VERY HIGHAND I NEVERTHOUGHT OF THERE BEING A DITCH THE OTHER SIDE. COME KITTY I CRIEDWE CAN DO THIS AND WENT FOR IT. I FANCY SOME ONE CALLED TO ME TOSTOP.I SHOUTED TO YOU SAID GUY. I THOUGHT YOU MUST BE MAD TO GO AT ITLIKE THAT.HE WISHED HE COULD RECALL THE WORDS WHEN HE SAW GLADYSS FACE BECOMECONVULSED WITH GRIEF. HE WOULD NOT WILLINGLY HAVE ADDED TO HER PAIN.I WAS MAD SHE SOBBED HYSTERICALLY. I WAS WILD WITH EXCITEMENT IFELT NO FEAR EVEN WHEN I SAW WHAT A LEAP IT WAS PANSY WAS TAKING. BUTTHE NEXT MOMENT THERE WAS A CRASH A CRY AND I SAW THAT KITTYS HORSEHAD FALLEN IN THE DITCH AND SHE WAS BENEATH HIM. OH THE HORROR OF ITI CAN NEVER FORGET IT. SHE LOOKED LIKE DEATH WHEN THEY LIFTED HER.OH DO NOT SAY SO IMPLORED ALDYTH. SHE TURNED TO GUY IN AN AGONY OFFEAR. IT IS NOT SO BAD AS THAT SHE WILL RECOVERGOD GRANT SHE MAY HE MURMURED MORE MOVED THAN SHE HAD EVER SEENHIM. BUTIT WAS ENOUGH TO KILL HER.AND THAT WAS ALL THE COMFORT ALDYTH COULD GLEAM FROM THEM.CHAPTER XXVIII.KITTY SHOWS THE STRENGTH OF HER CHARACTER.THE STROKE OF CALAMITY WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HER HOME ROUSED HILDA BLANDTO AN AWFUL SENSE OF THE REALITIES OF LIFE. SHE HAD BEEN LIVING INSELFISH DREAMS NURSING A SICKLY SENTIMENTALISM WITH THE ASSURANCETHAT SHE WAS ALTOGETHER AN EXCEPTIONAL BEING EXCEPTIONALLY HIGHSTRUNGAND SENSITIVE AND WRAPPED IN A MISERY WHICH NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND.SELFPITY HAD COMBINED WITH SELFADMIRATION TO BLIND HER TO THE FACTTHAT THERE WERE OTHER SORROWS IN THE WORLD BESIDES HER OWN. SHE HADSEEN HERSELF A PATIENT SUFFERER MISCONCEIVED SLIGHTED UNPITIED ONESINGLED OUT BY FATE FOR THE ENDOWMENT OF PECULIAR SORROW.AND ALL THE WHILE SHE HAD BEEN AS ONE WHO DREAMS OF STORMS IN HISWARMLY CURTAINED BED. BUT NOW A REAL BLAST HAD AWAKENED HER TO ASUDDEN PAINED PERCEPTION OF WHAT HUMAN LIFE IS IN A WORLD WHERE DEATHAND PAIN AND LOSS ARE GODS MINISTERS TO MAN.THERE WAS NOTHING ROMANTIC IN THE BLOW THAT HAD SHATTERED THEIR HAPPYHOME LIFE. HILDAS HEART SICKENED WITHIN HER AT THE THOUGHT OF THETERRIBLE INJURY OF THE FAINT CHANCE THAT KITTY WOULD SURVIVE IT ANDTHE ALMOST CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE THAT THE LIFE IF PRESERVED WOULD BE AHELPLESS MAIMED EXISTENCE. AND TO THINK THAT ON KITTY OF ALL PERSONSSUCH A DOOM SHOULD FALLKITTY ALWAYS SO FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY WHOLIKED TO TRY HER STRENGTH IN EVERY FORM OF EXERCISE WHO NEVER SEEMEDTO FEEL FATIGUE.IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSOCIATE PAIN AND HELPLESSNESS WITH KITTY. YETHILDA KNEW THAT MANY ANOTHER BRIGHT YOUNG LIFE HAD BEEN BLIGHTED BY ASIMILAR CATASTROPHE. SUCH TRIALS HAD BEEN AND WOULD BE AGAIN. AND ITWAS VAIN TO RISK THE WHY AND WHEREFORE.IT IS GODS WILL HER MOTHER WAS ABLE TO WHISPER IN THE MIDST OF HERANGUISH BUT TO HILDA THAT THOUGHT COULD YIELD NO SUPPORT. SHE HAD NOTLEARNED TO TRUST THE WILL THAT EMBRACES AND CONTROLS ALL HUMAN LIFE.IF IT WERE GODS WILL SO TO AFFLICT KITTY THEN GOD WAS REGARDLESS OFHUMAN AGONY SHE SAID TO HERSELF.DESPITE HER CHERISHED DESIRE TO BECOME A NURSE HILDA WAS AT FIRST OFLITTLE USE IN THE SICKROOM. SHE LACKED THE NERVE AND SELFCONTROLDEMANDED OF ONE WHO WOULD SERVE THERE. BUT SHE WAS HARDLY NEEDED FORNOTHING WOULD INDUCE MRS. BLAND TO QUIT THE BEDSIDE. WITHOUT FLINCHINGOUTWARDLY SHE STOOD AT HER POST HELPING THE SURGEONS WATCHINGWAITING PRAYING UNTIL THE HOUR WHEN THE EXPERIENCED SURGEON SUMMONEDFROM LONDON FOR CONSULTATION ASSURED HER THAT THE PATIENT WOULDLIVEWOULD LIVEGUARDING HIMSELF FROM USING ANY EXPRESSION THAT SHOULDCONVEY THE IDEA OF RESTORATION TO HEALTH.BUT AT FIRST IT SEEMED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT KITTY WOULD NOT DIE. THEREWAS ROOM FOR HOPE TO FLOURISH IF LIFE WERE GRANTED. WITH TEARS INHER EYES HILDA TOLD THE GOOD NEWS TO ALDYTH WHO CAME EVERY DAY TOSEE HER AND WAS HER CHIEF COMFORT IN THIS SEASON OF SORROW. ALDYTHMADE THE MOST OF EACH GLEAM OF HOPE THOUGH IN THE BACKGROUND OF HERMIND WAS THE DREAR PROBABILITY WHICH THE GOSSIPS OF WOODHAM FINDINGSOMETHING NOT UNPLEASANTLY THRILLING IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF KITTYSCRIPPLED LIFE HAD DECIDED MUST BE THE RESULT OF HER ACCIDENT.MR. RUSSELL SMITH IS COMING DOWN AGAIN IN A FEW WEEKS TIME HILDASAID. MEANWHILE IT IS SUCH A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT THE WORST DANGER ISOVER.AND KITTY IS CONSCIOUS NOW ALDYTH SAID.YES SHE KNOWS US. WE CANNOT TELL HOW MUCH SHE CAN REMEMBER. SHE GAVEME SUCH A FAINT SAD LITTLE SMILE THIS MORNINGIT MADE ME CRYAND SHESAID TO MOTHER CHEER UP MOTHER I AM NOT GOING TO DIE.DOES SHE SUFFER PAINTERRIBLE PAIN. THEY GIVE HER MORPHIA TO DEADEN IT BUT EVEN SO SHESUFFERS. I SEE HER CLENCH HER HANDS AND BITE HER LIPS TO KEEP FROMCRYING OUT. SHE IS SO BRAVE POOR KITTYYES SHE WAS ALWAYS BRAVE SAID ALDYTH.OH IF THIS HAD HAPPENED TO ME I COULD UNDERSTAND IT EXCLAIMEDHILDA BURSTING INTO TEARS. I DESERVE TO SUFFERI HAVE LED SUCH ASELFISH IDLE LIFE. WHAT WERE MY TROUBLES AFTER ALL I WAS STRONGAND WELL AND COULD ENJOY EVERYTHING BUT TO BE STRICKEN DOWN LIKEKITTYOH IT IS TERRIBLEGLADYS CANNOT FORGIVE HERSELF BECAUSE SHE LED KITTY INTO DANGER SAIDALDYTH. SHE FEELS IT VERY MUCH.I DARE SAY I KEEP THINKING OF HOW EASILY IT ALL MIGHT HAVE BEENPREVENTED AND I KNOW MOTHER MUST REPROACH HERSELF BITTERLY FORYIELDING HER CONSENT TO THE HUNTING. BUT IT IS OF NO GOOD TO DWELL ONTHAT NOW.NO IT IS TOO LATE SAID ALDYTH SADLY AS SHE ROSE TO TAKE HERDEPARTURE.MUST YOU GO SAID HILDA CLINGING TO HER. WELL IT IS GOOD OF YOUTO COME. GIVE MY LOVE TO GLADYS AND TELL HER SHE MUST NOT BE HARD ONHERSELF.THANK YOU. SHE AND MOTHER ARE GOING TO LONDON ON THURSDAY TO SPEND AFEW WEEKS. I TRUST THE CHANGE WILL DO THEM BOTH GOOD FOR MOTHER NEEDSIT AS MUCH AS GLADYS. SHE SLEEPS SO BADLY AND IS LOSING HER APPETITE.I WANT HER TO CONSULT A PHYSICIAN BUT SHE DECLARES THAT A DOCTOR CANDO HER NO GOOD.NO DOUBT THE CHANGE WILL SET HER UP. SO YOU WILL BE ALONE I AMSELFISHLY GLAD FOR I HOPE TO SEE THE MORE OF YOU.AUNTIE WILL BE WITH ME A GREAT DEAL BUT OF COURSE I SHALL OFTEN BE ATWOODHAM. INDEED I CANNOT KEEP AWAY NOW I AM ALWAYS THINKING OF KITTY.MISS LORRAINE WAS PLEASED TO STAY AT WYNDHAM WITH ALDYTH WHILST HERMOTHER WAS AWAY. SHE WAS NOT A FREQUENT VISITOR THERE AT OTHER TIMES.SHE COULD CHAT MORE FREELY WITH HER NIECE IN HER OWN HOME. SHE HADNEVER FELT MUCH AFFECTION FOR MRS. STANTON AND OFTEN FOUND HERPATIENCE AND TOLERANCE SEVERELY TRIED WHEN IN HER COMPANY. IT VEXEDHER TO SEE HOW COMPLETELY MRS. STANTON MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF HERDAUGHTERS HOUSE. HER TASTES HER WISHES RULED EVERYTHING. THE SERVANTSINSTINCTIVELY APPEALED TO HER ON EVERY MATTER ALDYTHS REIGN WASMERELY NOMINAL.I WOULD NOT STAND IT IF I WERE ALDYTH MISS LORRAINE WOULD SAYTO HERSELF PERFECTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THIS STATE OF THINGS WASEXACTLY WHAT ALDYTH DESIRED. SHE NEVER DREAMED OF MAINTAINING HERRIGHTS IN OPPOSITION TO HER MOTHER THE HOME WAS FOR HER MOTHER ANDHER PLEASURE HER COMFORT SHOULD BE THE CHIEF CONSIDERATION SHE WASREADY TO DEFER TO HER WISHES IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. BUT IF A QUESTIONOF DUTY WERE INVOLVED ALDYTH COULD HOLD HER OWN. WHEN HER MOTHERDENOUNCED ALDYTHS SCHEME FOR ESTABLISHING A COUNTRY HOME FOR FACTORYGIRLS AS QUIXOTIC IN THE EXTREME AND AN ABSURD WASTE OF MONEY HERWORDS HAD SURPRISINGLY LITTLE EFFECT.I AM SORRY YOU THINK IT ABSURD MAMMA ALDYTH SAID CALMLY BUTI MEAN TO TRY HOW THE PLAN WILL WORK. I COULD NOT FEEL AT EASE INPOSSESSING SO MUCH IF I MADE NO EFFORT TO SHARE MY GOOD THINGS WITHSOME OF MY LESS FORTUNATE SISTERS.I THINK YOU HAVE MANAGED TO SHARE THEM PRETTY CONSIDERABLY ALREADYSAID GLADYS WHO WAS PRESENT. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR OLD UNCLE WOULDHAVE LEFT YOU WYNDHAM IF HE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT WE SHOULD ALL COMEAND LIVE HERE. CERTAINLY YOU INHERITED IT BY RATHER A FLUKE FOR GUYSAYS HE IS SURE THAT MR. LORRAINE MEANT TO MAKE ANOTHER WILL.IT IS VERY BAD TASTE OF GUY TO NAME SUCH A THING TO YOU. I WONDER YOULET HIM CRIED MRS. STANTON WITH SUDDEN PASSION IN HER VOICE.OH THERE WAS NO HARM IN IT SAID GLADYS CARELESSLY.ALDYTH LOOKED AT HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE.HER EYES WERE ABLAZE A CRIMSON SPOT BURNED IN EACH CHEEK THE HANDSWHICH HELD HER WORK TREMBLED VISIBLY. SHE MET HER DAUGHTERS WONDERINGGLANCE AND QUAILED BEFORE IT. FOR A MOMENT SHE COULD ALMOST IMAGINETHAT ALDYTH READ HER GUILTY SECRET. SHE SHUDDERED AT THE VERY THOUGHTOF SUCH A THING. IT WOULD BE DREADFUL IF ALDYTH WERE TO DISCOVER WHATSHE HAD DONE. WOULD IT BE BETTER TO MAKE DISCOVERY IMPOSSIBLE BYDESTROYING THE WILL FROM THAT HOUR HER MOTHER LEFT ALDYTH FREE TOSPEND HER MONEY AS SHE WOULD CAREFULLY REFRAINING FROM ANY COMMENTTHAT MIGHT PROVOKE DISCUSSION OF ALDYTHS INHERITANCE OR HER UNCLESPOSSIBLE INTENTIONS.BY THE END OF MARCH THE COTTAGE WAS IN A HABITABLE CONDITION. ANDWHILST HER MOTHER WAS ABSENT ALDYTH BUSIED HERSELF WITH HER AUNTSASSISTANCE IN FITTING IT UP FOR THE RECEPTION OF HER GUESTS. IT WASPLEASANT WORK. ALDYTH LOVED TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE THE SENSATIONS OFCERTAIN OF THOSE TOILWORN WORKING GIRLS FROM THE EASTEND WHEN THEYFOUND THEMSELVES AMIDST THE GREEN FIELDS AND COPSES OF WYNDHAM.BUT EVER HER HEART WAS SHADOWED BY THE THOUGHT OF KITTY BLAND. HERCONDITION DID NOT GREATLY IMPROVE. AGAIN THE EMINENT LONDON SURGEONWAS SUMMONED TO GIVE HIS OPINION. HIS WORDS FELL HEAVILY ON THE HEARTSOF KITTYS FRIENDS YET HE DID NOT WITHHOLD ALL HOPE. THE SPINE HADRECEIVED SERIOUS PERHAPS PERMANENT INJURY BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE THATNATURE AIDED BY EVERY MEANS SCIENCE COULD SUGGEST MIGHT IN TIMEEFFECT A CURE. JUST POSSIBLE THAT WAS ALL AND NO ONE COULD SAY HOWLONG THE CURE MIGHT BE IN PROGRESS. ONLY THE FAINTEST THREAD OF HOPE TOCLING TO AMIDST THE PRESENT CERTAINTY OF PAIN AND HELPLESSNESS.ALDYTH WAS DEEPLY GRIEVED WHEN HILDA TOLD HER THE STATE OF THE CASE.HOW COULD KITTY BEAR ITDOES SHE KNOW ASKED ALDYTH.YES SHE INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE SURGEON HAD SAID. MOTHER COULDHARDLY BEAR TO TELL HER BUT SHE TOOK IT SO QUIETLY SHE EVEN TRIED TOSMILE AND SAID IN SOMEWHAT OF HER OLD FUNNY WAY YOU HAVE ME SAFENOW MOTHER I CAN NEVER RUN AWAY FROM YOU AGAIN.WHAT A SPIRIT SHE HAS SAID ALDYTH.AH INDEED BUT YOU KNOW I ALMOST WISH SHE WOULD GIVE WAY IT MUST BEA TERRIBLE STRAIN TO BEAR UP AS SHE DOES FOR I CAN SEE THAT HER HEARTIS BREAKING THE WHILE. IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF MOTHER. KITTY WAS ALWAYSSO GOOD TO MOTHER. SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU ALDYTH SHE SAID SO THISMORNING.THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SAID ALDYTH BUT NOT WITHOUT A SENSEOF INWARD SHRINKING.HILDA WENT AWAY BUT RETURNED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO SAY THAT KITTYWISHED TO SEE ALDYTH AT ONCE.I AM NOT TO COME IN HILDA SAID AS SHE OPENED THE BEDROOM DOOR.KITTY WANTS TO HAVE YOU TO HERSELF.A FOLDING SCREEN STOOD NEAR THE DOOR. ALDYTH HAD TO ADVANCE TO THEOTHER SIDE OF IT ERE SHE SAW KITTY. THEN SHE RECEIVED A PAINFUL THRILL.THE PALE WORN FACE WITH ITS STRAINED LOOK OF SUFFERING WAS SO UNLIKETHE FACE OF HER OLD FRIEND THE EYES UNNATURALLY LARGE AND DARK INCONTRAST TO THE SHRUNKEN FEATURES MET HERS WITH A PATHETIC APPEAL FORSYMPATHY.KITTYS LIPS MOVED BUT NO SOUND PASSED THEM. THE SIGHT OF ALDYTH WASTOO MUCH. EMOTION COULD NO LONGER BE SUPPRESSED. A SUDDEN RUSH OF TEARSMADE SPEECH IMPOSSIBLE.KITTY WAS ALL ALDYTH COULD SAY.THEN SHE CAST HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE THE BED CLASPING KITTYSHAND AND SHOWERING KISSES ON IT.MRS. BLANDS KNITTING LAY UPON A CHAIR. IT WAS WELL THAT SHE HADBEEN CALLED AWAY. KITTYS OVERBURDENED HEART WAS RELIEVING ITSELF BYPASSIONATE SOBS THE TEARS RAINED DOWN HER CHEEKS AS FAST AS ALDYTHCOULD WIPE THEM AWAY. ALDYTH HAD NO WORDS TO GIVE HER ONLY TEARS ANDKISSES BUT THESE WERE NOT WITHOUT POWER TO SOOTHE. GRADUALLY THE STORMPASSED. KITTY MADE AN EFFORT TO QUIET HER SOBS.FORGIVE ME ALDYTH SHE SAID BROKENLY. YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT IS.NO I CANNOT KNOW ALDYTHS WORDS FALTERED TOO BUT I FEEL FOR YOUSO MUCH.I KNOW YOU DO. EVERY ONE FEELS FOR ME I ALMOST WISH THEY DID NOT. IFI COULD CRY OUT IT WOULD BE EASIER BUT I CANNOT GIVE WAY FOR THEIRSAKE. IT IS HARD ENOUGH FOR MOTHER AS IT IS.IT IS BRAVE OF YOU TO BEAR IT SO KITTY.BRAVE OH ALDYTH YOU DO NOT KNOW IF YOU COULD READ MY HEART YOUWOULD NOT CALL ME BRAVE. I HAVE NO COURAGE TO FACE THE FUTURE. ALWAYSTO BE LIKE THISNOT ALWAYS I TRUST. REMEMBER THERE IS HOPE.I DARE NOT CHERISH THAT HOPE SAID KITTY MOURNFULLY. NO IT IS BESTTO SAY ALWAYS. I DO NOT SUPPOSE IT MAKES MUCH DIFFERENCE TO A PRISONERWHEN THE DOOR OF HIS PRISON CLOSES ON HIM WHETHER HIS IMPRISONMENT ISFOR LIFE OR A LONG TERM OF YEARS.IT MUST BE GOOD TO HOPE SAID ALDYTH THERE WILL BE ALLEVIATIONS.WILL THERE OH YOU MEAN THAT I MAY PERHAPS BE WHEELED ABOUT ON ANINVALID COUCH NOW TO THIS ROOM AND NOW TO THAT AND TAKEN INTO THEGARDEN ONCE IN A WHILE. I WHO USED TO GO ANYWHERE AND DO ANYTHING.ALDYTH I CANNOT BEAR ITSTRENGTH WILL BE GIVEN YOU DEAR KITTY. AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOBRAVE.AH BUT THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT SORT OF COURAGE. ALDYTH DID I EVERTELL YOU THAT WHEN WE WERE IN BRITTANY WE SAW THE OLD CASTLE WHERE THELADY OF LA GARRAYE LIVED MRS. LANCASTER BOUGHT THE BOOK AND I READIT. THE SAD STORY MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON ME. I REMEMBER THINKING ONTHAT BRIGHT MORNING AS WE RAMBLED ABOUT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THEOLD CASTLE WHAT A TERRIBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO HAVE ALL THE HAPPINESSSWEPT OUT OF ONES LIFE IN THAT MANNER. HEALTH BEAUTY STRENGTHALLGONE IN A DAY I FELT THAT I COULD NOT BEAR IT AND NOW IT HAS COME TOME.IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY THE END OF THE STORY WAS NOT SAD KITTYALDYTH SAID.NO SHE BECAME RESIGNED TO THE WILL OF GOD SHE FOUND PEACE KITTYSAID TREMULOUSLY. OH ALDYTH IT IS EASY TO TALK OF RESIGNATION WHENONE IS NOT TRIED.YES INDEED I HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK OF IT SAID ALDYTH BUTGO ON SAID KITTY AS SHE HESITATED SAY ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO MEALDYTH I KNOW YOU ONLY WANT TO HELP ME.I WAS THINKING THAT RESIGNATION IS OFTEN THE HIGHEST COURAGE. TO BEARPAIN AND WEAKNESS AND LOSS OF FREEDOM WITH FORTITUDE IS A PROOF OFBRAVERY IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS WHO WINS THE VICTORIA CROSS. YOUHAVE READ THE HISTORY OF A SHORT LIFE KITTYYES AND I REMEMBER. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I SHALL HARDLY WIN MYVICTORIA CROSS.YOU WILL NOT IN YOUR OWN STRENGTH. YOU ARE NOT LEFT TO YOURSELF.KITTY I SHALL PRAY THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SAY I CAN DO OR BEAR ALLTHINGS THROUGH HIM THAT STRENGTHENETH ME.KITTY GENTLY PRESSED THE HAND THAT STILL HELD HERS BUT DID NOT SPEAK.TEARS WERE GATHERING AFRESH IN HER EYES BUT THEY WERE NO LONGERBITTER HOPELESS TEARS. SHE LAY FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING ANDALDYTH THINKING HER EXHAUSTED KEPT SILENCE ALSO. THEIR HEARTS DREWVERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE UNSEEN PRESENCE IN THE STILLNESS.THEN MRS. BLAND ENTERED BRINGING SOME LOVELY FLOWERS THAT A FRIEND HADSENT.KITTY ROUSED HERSELF TO ADMIRE THEM. THEY MUST BE BROUGHT CLOSE THATSHE MIGHT ENJOY THEIR PERFUME. SHE SMILED ON HER MOTHER AS SHE BENTOVER HER. SHE CHARGED ALDYTH WITH A MESSAGE FOR GLADYS THEN SHEWHISPERED IN ALDYTHS EAR AS SHE KISSED HERCOME AGAIN SOONCOME OFTEN YOU MUST HELP ME TO WIN MY VICTORIA CROSS.ALDYTH READILY PROMISED SHE WAS SO THANKFUL TO SEE A GLEAM OF COMFORTON KITTYS FACE.MRS. BLAND CRONE OUT OF THE ROOM WITH HER AND SHE TOO BEGGED ALDYTH TOCOME OFTEN.YOU HAVE DONE HER GOOD SHE SAID SHE HAS OPENED HER HEART TO YOUAND IT HAS RELIEVED HER. BUT IT IS WONDERFUL HOW SHE BEARS IT. SUCHCOURAGE SUCH FORTITUDE SHE MAKES ME ASHAMED OF MYSELF.AND ALDYTH TURNED AWAY WITH THE THOUGHT THAT KITTY WAS PROVING HERSELFA TRUE HEROINE ALTHOUGH SHE HAD PASSED FOR A COMMONPLACE MORTAL.CHAPTER XXIX.A MIND DISEASED.MRS. STANTON CAME HOME LOOKING LITTLE BETTER FOR HER MONTHS STAY INTOWN. HER FACE HAD STILL A WORN AND HARASSED LOOK AND SHE RESPONDED INA FRETFUL TONE TO ALDYTHS LOVING GREETING.YES I AM VERY TIRED. THE TRAIN WAS LATE AT WICKHAM IT IS SO TIRESOMEHAVING TO WAIT THERE. OH WHAT A DEADALIVE PLACE WOODHAM LOOKS AFTERLONDON I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW I CAN EXIST HERE.ALDYTH HAD BRIGHTENED HER MOTHERS ROOM WITH FRESH DRAPERIES AND SPRINGFLOWERS BUT PLEASANT AS THE ROOM LOOKED MRS. STANTONS HEART SANKWITHIN HER AS SHE ENTERED IT. THE PLACE WAS ASSOCIATED FOR HER WITHSLEEPLESS NIGHTS PAINFULLY INSISTENT THOUGHTS AND A HEAVY WEIGHT OFDREAD. SHE SHIVERED AS HER GLANCE FELL ON THE WARDROBE IN WHICH LOCKEDAWAY IN HER TRAVELLING DESK WAS THE WILL WHICH SHE DARED NOT DESTROYDARED NOT EVEN LOOK UPON AGAIN BUT DESIRED TO KEEP HIDDEN FOR EVER.YOU ARE COLD SAID ALDYTH HASTENING TO GIVE THE FIRE A STIR. THEWIND IS VERY CHILL ALTHOUGH THE SUNSHINE IS SO BRILLIANT. BUT SPRINGIS ADVANCING YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO SEE HOW BRIGHT THE GARDEN LOOKS.MRS. STANTON TURNED TO THE WINDOW WHICH COMMANDED ONE SIDE OF THEGARDEN. ON THE PATH BELOW WERE GLADYS AND GUY SEARCHING THE VIOLET BEDFOR FLOWERS AND LAUGHING AND TALKING MERRILY THE WHILE.HERE ALREADY EXCLAIMED MRS. STANTON IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE AS SHEDREW BACK. GUY MIGHT HAVE SPARED US HIS COMPANY FOR THIS ONE EVENING.IT IS SILLY OF GLADYS TO ENCOURAGE HIM AS SHE DOES.SOMETIMES I WONDER IF GLADYS REALLY CARES FOR HIM ALDYTH VENTURED TOSAY.ALDYTH EXCLAIMED HER MOTHER IN A TONE OF REPROACH. WHAT DO YOUMEAN PRAY GIVE YOUR SISTER CREDIT FOR SOME COMMON SENSE. HOW IS ITPOSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD CARE FOR GUYALDYTH MIGHT HAVE REPLIED THAT ATTACHMENTS ARE NOT INVARIABLY FOUNDEDON COMMON SENSE PRINCIPLES. EVEN THE MOST PRUDENT ARE OCCASIONALLYBETRAYED BY FEELING. BUT SHE KEPT SILENCE WHILST HER MOTHER CONTINUEDIMPATIENTLY IF YOUR WORDS MEAN WHAT I SUPPOSE YOU MUST KNOWTHAT SUCH A THING IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. I COULD NEVER GIVE MYCONSENTUNLESS INDEED GUYS POSITION WERE MATERIALLY CHANGED.MRS. STANTONS CHEEKS FLUSHED AS SHE UTTERED THE LAST WORDS.

I AM SORRY HE HAS COME SINCE YOUDISLIKE HIM SO.I DO DISLIKE HIM SAID MRS. STANTON. I DISLIKE HIM MORE AND MOREEACH TIME I SEE HIM.THE NEXT MOMENT THE WORDS SEEMED TO HER A DANGEROUS ADMISSION AND SHEWISHED SHE COULD RECALL THEM.ALDYTH FOUND THAT GLADYS HAD ALREADY DISMISSED GUY WHO HAD MERELYLOOKED IN ON SOME SLIGHT PRETEXT IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN IF SHE HADARRIVED. HIS VISIT HAD BEEN HIGHLY ENTERTAINING TO GLADYS. HISAPPEARANCE HIS WORDS HIS WAYS ALL MOVED HER TO RIDICULE. SHE BEGANTO GIVE ALDYTH INSTANCES OF HIS ABSURDITY LAUGHING AT HIM SO HEARTILYTHAT ALDYTH FELT IT WAS FOOLISH OF HER TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THATGLADYS COULD SERIOUSLY CARE FOR HIM. SHE LAUNCHED HER SATIRE AT HIMWITH SUCH VEHEMENCE THAT ALDYTH FELT COMPELLED TO SAY A GOOD WORD ONHIS BEHALF.COME COME GLADYS SHE SAID GUY IS REALLY NOT SO BAD AS THAT.HE IS NOT LACKING IN PHYSICAL COURAGE. HOW IS IT THAT YOU AND MAMMADISLIKE GUY SO MUCHDOES MAMMA DISLIKE HIM ASKED GLADYS CHANGING COLOUR.SO SHE HAS JUST DECLARED TO ME BUT I THINK SHE IS PERHAPS OUT OFSORTS. SHE DOES NOT LOOK WELL GLADYS. THE CHANGE HAS NOT APPARENTLYDONE HER MUCH GOOD.SHE HAS BEEN OUT OF SORTS NOT TO SAY CROSS ALL THE TIME REPLIEDGLADYS. I FEAR I AM RATHER A TRIAL TO MAMMA. THE PRINCE WHO IS TOMAKE MY FORTUNE DECLINES TO APPEAR. WE MET CAPTAIN WALKER IN TOWNALDYTH AND MAMMA HAD ALL KINDS OF PLANS FOR BRINGING HIM HERE BUTALAS HE WAS ABOUT TO SAIL FOR INDIA WITH HIS REGIMENT. THAT WAS ADISAPPOINTMENT FOR MAMMA. HE WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH AN ARISTOCRATICSONINLAW.GLADYS IT IS VERY NAUGHTY OF YOU TO TALK IN THAT WAY.NOW ALDYTH YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE. WELL WE HAVE FRESH SCHEMES NOW.MY MOURNING IS TO BE SLIGHTED MAMMA HAS BOUGHT ME SOME CHARMING GREYAND WHITE GOWNS. WE SPENT EVERY PENNY OF YOUR CHEQUE. THERE ARE TO BEDINNER PARTIES AND TENNISPARTIES AND WHAT NOT THIS SUMMER. IT IS TO BEHOPED THEY WILL HAVE THE DESIRED RESULT AND THAT I SHALL SOON CEASE TOBE A PENSIONER ON YOUR BOUNTY.HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO SAID ALDYTH REPROACHFULLY. IT IS UNKIND OFYOU. AS IF I WERE NOT YOUR SISTER GLADYS PROMISE ME YOU WILL NEVERALLOW ANY FEELING OF THAT KIND TO DRAW YOU INTO A MARRIAGE TO WHICHYOUR HEART DOES CONSENT.YOU DEAR ROMANTIC OLD THING CRIED GLADYS THROWING ARMS ABOUT HERSISTER AND KISSING HER WARMLY. NO I WILL PROMISE NOTHING OF THE KINDIT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO MAMMA. SUDDENLY RELAXING HER EMBRACE SHE RANOFF LAUGHING.AT NIGHT WHEN ALDYTH WAS HELPING HER MOTHER TO UNDRESS MRS. STANTONSAID TO HER I WISH YOU WOULD STAY WITH ME TONIGHT ALDYTH I FEEL SONERVOUS. I SHALL SLEEP BETTER IF I HAVE A COMPANION.VERY WELL MAMMA SAID ALDYTH THAT IS EASILY ARRANGED.I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU ALWAYS WITH ME SAID MRS. STANTON WITHMORE FEELING THAN SHE OFTEN BETRAYED. YOU MUST NEVER LEAVE ME ALDYTH.I NEVER WILL IF I CAN HELP IT MOTHER DEAR.BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL MARRY SOME DAY SAID MRS. STANTON LOOKING ATHER DAUGHTER.THAT IS NOT LIKELY MAMMA.YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY ONE FOR WHOM YOU COULD CARETHE COLOUR ROSE IN ALDYTHS FACE BUT SHE ANSWERED STEADILY I HAVENOT THE LEAST IDEA OF MARRYING ANY ONE MAMMA. ALL I WANT IS TO STAYWITH YOU AND TAKE CARE OF YOU.MRS. STANTON WAS CONTENT.ALDYTH HAD SPOKEN IN SINCERITY. NOT THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN JOHN GLYNNE.SHE COULD NOT WISH TO FORGET HIM. IT WOULD ALWAYS BE GOOD TO HAVE KNOWNSUCH A STRONG TRUE MAN. BUT SHE HAD RESOLUTELY STRIVEN TO PUT FROM HERANY HOPE INSPIRED BY THE MEMORY OF HIS PARTING WORDS. THE CHANCE WAS SOSLIGHT. HE MIGHT NEVER RETURN BUT IF HE DID RETURN THE CIRCUMSTANCESOF HER LIFE WOULD STILL SEPARATE THEM. WITH HER MOTHER DEPENDING WHOLLYUPON HER THE PATH OF DUTY WAS PLAIN SHE COULD NOT TURN ASIDE FROM ITNOR WOULD SHE HEED ANY SELFISH WHISPER THAT SHOULD SUGGEST TO HER AHAPPIER WAY.THE SPRINGS WERE ALWAYS COLD AT WOODHAM BUT THIS SEASON HAD MORE THANITS SHARE OF EAST WIND. IT WAS JUNE ERE THE WEATHER SET IN REALLY WARM.MRS. STANTON GRUMBLED CONTINUALLY AT THE CLIMATE AND REALLY SUFFEREDFROM ITS SEVERITY. SHE WAS FALLING INTO A DEBILITATED STATE OF HEALTHWHICH RENDERED HER VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHILLS. ALDYTH DID HER BEST TORELIEVE THE GLOOM WHICH WEIGHED ON HER MOTHERS MIND. IT SEEMED BUTA NATURAL EFFECT OF THE GREAT CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED IN HER LIFE.ALDYTH WOULD REMIND HERSELF OF THIS WHEN HER MOTHER WAS MORE THANUSUALLY IRRITABLE AND RESTLESS.MRS. STANTON COULD NO LONGER REASONABLY COMPLAIN OF THE DULNESS OF HERHOME. VISITORS CAME FREQUENTLY TO WYNDHAM AS THE SPRING ADVANCED. MR.GREENWOOD FOUND BUSINESS TO BRING HIM TO THE HALL ALMOST EVERY WEEK.IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE NEW TENNISGROUND AT WYNDHAM WAS ONE OF THEBEST IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. GLADYS SO PRETTY AND GAY WON ADMIRERS OFBOTH SEXES AND HAD ALDYTH BEEN OF A SMALLER NATURE SHE MIGHT HAVE FELTJEALOUS OF THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION BESTOWED ON HER SISTER. EVEN AS THEHEIRESS OF WYNDHAM SHE HAD OFTEN TO PLAY A SECONDARY PART.BUT ALDYTH WAS NOT AMBITIOUS OF SOCIAL DISTINCTION AND THETENNISPARTIES WERE SPOILED FOR HER BY THE THOUGHT OF KITTY BLAND ACHAMPION PLAYER LYING HELPLESS ON HER COUCH OF PAIN. ALDYTH SPENT MANYAN HOUR WITH HER FRIEND AND GLADYS TOO WENT FREQUENTLY TO SEE HER.AFTER THAT FIRST MEETING ALDYTH RARELY SAW KITTY GIVE WAY TO TEARS.HER CHEERFULNESS WAS INDEED A CONTINUAL ASTONISHMENT TO GLADYS. GAYIDLE AS GLADYS OFTEN APPEARED ALDYTH COULD PERCEIVE THAT SHE WASNOT QUITE SO THOUGHTLESS AS SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE KITTYS ACCIDENT. THETIME SPENT WITH KITTY MOVED HER TO REFLECTION. SHE GRADUALLY GAINEDSOME INSIGHT INTO THE SECRET OF KITTYS BRAVE ENDURANCE WITH THERESULT THAT SHE BECAME DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF AND BEGAN TO LONGFOR A HIGHER LIFE THAN THE MERE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE WHICH HAD HITHERTOCONTENTED HER. KITTYS DAYS OF ENFORCED IDLENESS WERE NOT SO FRUITLESSAS SHE IMAGINED SHE WAS EXERTING A LASTING INFLUENCE FOR GOOD ON OTHERLIVES.SPRING GAVE PLACE TO SUMMER BUT MRS. STANTONS SPIRITS DID NOTIMPROVE. SHE WOULD EXERT HERSELF AND APPEAR ANIMATED WHEN VISITORS WEREPRESENT BUT ON THEIR DEPARTURE SHE SANK BACK INTO A WEARY STATE OFDEPRESSION.ONE EVENING ALDYTH CAME BACK FROM A VISIT TO MISS LORRAINE AND FOUNDHER MOTHER ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM. SHE HAD A BOOK IN HER HAND BUTSHE WAS NOT READING WHEN ALDYTHS SUDDEN ENTRANCE CAUSED HER TO STARTNERVOUSLY. ALDYTH SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO DRAW OFF HER GLOVES. SHE WOULDENLIVEN HER MOTHER WITH A PIECE OF NEWS SHE HAD LEARNED. CLARA DAWTREYWAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED.MISS LORRAINE HAD TOLD THE NEWS IN HER USUAL RACY STYLE AND ALDYTHSEYES SPARKLED WITH FUN AS SHE RECALLED HER AUNTS WORDS. SHE HAD NOTTHE LEAST IDEA THAT CLARAS ENGAGEMENT COULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HER.WHAT IS AMUSING YOU SO ALDYTH HER MOTHER INQUIRE IN RATHER AFRETFUL TONE.I HAVE HEARD SOME NEWS SAID ALDYTH NODDING HER HEAD. WHO ISENGAGED TO BE MARRIED DO YOU THINKDO NOT ASK ME TO GUESS SAID MRS. STANTON IMPATIENTLY I HATEGUESSING THINGS.WELL THEN IT IS CLARA DAWTREY.

HE IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED WITH ESSEX AUNT SAYS AND CLARA DAWTREYTOLD HER THAT HE HAD HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH UNCLE.UNCLE REPEATED MRS. STANTON FEEBLY.YES UNCLE STEPHEN I MEAN. WHAT IS THE MATTER MAMMA DO YOU KNOWANYTHING OF THIS MR. GOULDCERTAINLY NOT. HOW SHOULD I ASKED MRS. STANTON SHARPLY VEXED WITHHERSELF FOR BETRAYING AGITATION.SOMETHING IS THE MATTER YOU ARE FEELING ILL SAID ALDYTH RISINGAND LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT HER MOTHERS PALLID SHRINKING COUNTENANCE.I AM NOT WELL SAID MRS. STANTON AND A BURST OF TEARS RELIEVED HER.MY HEAD ACHES. IT IS GOING TO THUNDER I BELIEVE. YES THERE MUST BETHUNDER IN THE AIR.IT DOES NOT FEEL TO ME LIKE THUNDERWEATHER SAID ALDYTH GLANCING ATTHE SKY.BUT THE STORM MRS. STANTON DREADED WAS OF ANOTHER KIND. GOULD SHE COULDNOT MISTAKE THE NAME IT WAS TOO DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HER MIND. SHE HADREAD IT ON THE HIDDEN WILL. JAMES GOULD WAS THE SIGNATURE OF ONE OF THEWITNESSES.CHAPTER XXX.THE WRONG DISCLOSED.GOOD WEATHER FOR THE CORN MISS ALDYTH BUT NOT ALTOGETHER COMFORTABLEFOR HUMAN BEINGS.THE SPEAKER WAS MR. RALPH GREENWOOD AND HE WAS ALIGHTING FROM A CHAISEAT THE ENTRANCE TO WYNDHAM. ALDYTH HAD JUST STEPPED INTO THE ROAD FROMA FIELD TO THE LEFT AND HE CHOSE TO GET DOWN AND WALK WITH HER.IT IS HOT SAID ALDYTH WHO HOWEVER IN HER WHITE AND LARGE HATLOOKED BY NO MEANS OPPRESSED BY THE HEAT.THE BROAD FLAT FIELDS WERE ONE BLAZE OF SUNLIGHT AND ONLY THE FAINTESTZEPHYR STIRRED THE LEAVES. ALDYTH SMILED TO SEE THE LITTLE LAWYERWIPING HIS BROW WITH AN AIR OF RESIGNATION. SHE WAS ALONE SAVE FOR HERUSUAL ATTENDANT A BEAUTIFUL SCOTCH COLLIE.IT WAS GOOD OF YOU TO DRIVE OUT ON SUCH A WARM AFTERNOON SHE SAIDTHERE IS NO SHADE WHATEVER ALONG THAT ROAD. BUT COME THIS WAY IT IS ANEARER AND PLEASANTER PATH TO THE HOUSE.SHE OPENED A LITTLE GATE INTO THE GROUNDS AND THEY FOLLOWED A NARROWWINDING PATH THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY. THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE CHAISEDROVE SLOWLY ON ALONG THE CARRIAGE DRIVE.AH THIS IS PLEASANT SAID MR. GREENWOOD RECOVERING HIS USUAL BRISKMANNER. I HAVE COME MISS ALDYTH BECAUSE THERE IS A LITTLE MATTER IMUST NAME TO YOU.OH IF IT IS BUSINESS PLEASE DO NOT BEGIN UPON IT TILL I HAVE HAD ACUP OF TEA SAID ALDYTH IMPLORINGLY THIS WEATHER DOES NOT STIMULATEONES BRAINS.THE LAWYER LAUGHED.PERHAPS NOT HE SAID THOUGH YOUR APPEARANCE GIVES A CONTRARYIMPRESSION. I FEARED MY COMING MIGHT ROUSE YOU FROM A SIESTA BUT YOURENERGY IS BEYOND EVERYTHING. HOW MANY MILES HAVE YOU BEEN WALKING INTHIS FERVENT HEATNOT ONE SAID ALDYTH. I HAVE ONLY BEEN TO THE COTTAGE. A FRESH PARTYOF GIRLS CAME FROM LONDON LAST EVENING. IT IS GOOD TO SEE THEIR DELIGHTIN THE PLACE. DESPITE THE HEAT IT SEEMS LIKE A PARADISE TO THEM.THEY WOULD HARDLY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE HEAT HERE AFTER EAST LONDON HEREPLIED. I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THOSE COURTS AND ALLEYS MUST BE LIKEON SUCH A DAY AS THIS. THEN YOUR PLAN IS WORKING WELLYES FAIRLY WELL SAID ALDYTH. POOR OLD MRS. DIBBINS WAS AT FIRSTRATHER FRIGHTENED OF THE GIRLS BUT SHE IS LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE THEM.THEY ARE ROUGH POOR THINGS THEY HAVE NO IDEA OF ENJOYING THEMSELVESQUIETLY BUT WE SHALL TAME THEM BY DEGREES. I GO DOWN EVERY DAY FOR ALITTLE WHILE.IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID MR. GREENWOOD.NO IT IS NOT GOOD SAID ALDYTH SHAKING HER HEAD IT IS JUST MYHOBBY. I CAN ASSURE YOU FEW THINGS HAVE GIVEN ME MORE PLEASURE THAN IHAVE FOUND IN ARRANGING THIS HOME. I AM SO GLAD I HAVE THE MEANS OFDOING IT.THEN YOU HAVE BECOME RECONCILED TO YOUR RICHES HE SAID WITH ONE OFHIS QUICK SHREWD GLANCES.I BELIEVE SO SAID ALDYTH SIMPLY. I VALUE THE POWER THAT MONEYCONFERS I AM AFRAID I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE IT NOW.STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE OBSERVED THE LAWYER THOUGHTFULLYSTROKING HIS CHIN.HIS WORDS HAD NO PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE FOR ALDYTH. SHE SUPPOSED THEMTO REFER TO HER UNEXPECTED ACQUISITION OF THE PROPERTY. THEY WEREAPPROACHING THE HOUSE. SHE LED HIM ACROSS THE LAWN AND THEY ENTERED BYONE OF THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS.ALDYTH REGRETTED THE UNCEREMONIOUS ENTRANCE AS SHE SAW HER MOTHERRISE PALE AND DISMAYED FROM THE SOFA. YET MRS. STANTON WAS NOTUNPREPARED FOR VISITORS. SHE WORE A BLACK GOWN OF SOME LIGHT DIAPHANOUSTEXTURE ELEGANTLY MADE AND BECOMING WELL HER TALL GRACEFUL FORM. SHECONQUERED HER NERVOUSNESS BY AN ASSUMPTION OF THE MOST QUEENLY DIGNITY.MR. GREENWOOD THOUGHT HER DEMEANOUR ABSURDLY HIGH AND MIGHTY BUTHE WAS MOVED TO PITY BY THE LOOK OF SUFFERING STAMPED ON THE PALEHANDSOME FEATURES.THIS HOT WEATHER IS TRYING YOU I FEAR HE SAID KINDLY. YOU DO NOTLOOK STRONG.I AM IN MY USUAL HEALTH THANK YOU SHE REPLIED SO HAUGHTILY THATHIS REMARK SEEMED AN IMPERTINENCE.WE MUST HAVE SOME TEA SAID ALDYTH MOVING TOWARDS THE BELL THAT ISWHAT WE WANTMR. GREENWOOD MOST OF ALL SINCE HE HAS DRIVEN ALONG THATHOT DUSTY ROAD TO SPEAK WITH ME ON BUSINESS.IF IT IS BUSINESS I HAD BETTER GO SAID MRS. STANTON HALF RISINGWITH A LANGUID MOVEMENT.MAMMA CRIED ALDYTH REPROACHFULLY. AS IF MY BUSINESS WERE NOTYOURSMRS. STANTON SANK BACK INTO HER PLACE. SHE WAS LONGING YET DREADING TOHEAR THE LAWYERS BUSINESS.IT IS NOTHING TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF SAID MR. GREENWOOD IN HIS EASYCHEERFUL MANNER. I ONLY WANT MISS ALDYTH TO BE KIND ENOUGH TO LET MELOOK THROUGH HER UNCLES PAPERS ONCE MORE. A CURIOUS FACT HAS COME TOLIGHT.THE BLOOD FLEW INTO MRS. STANTONS FACE HER HEART THROBBED WILDLY HERBREATH CAME FAST. WHAT WAS HE ABOUT TO SAYYOU HAVE HEARD OF MR. GOULD MISS DAWTREYS FIANC HE IS A SOLICITORPRACTISING IN LONDON HIS OFFICE IS IN CHANCERY LANE. WELL MR. GUYLORRAINE HAS LATELY MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND HAS HEARD FROM HIM ASTRANGE STORY. IT SEEMS THAT MR. STEPHEN LORRAINE ONLY A FEW MONTHSBEFORE HIS DEATHIN APRIL I BELIEVE IT WASWENT TO LONDON AND CALLEDON HIM. HE SAID HE WISHED TO MAKE A WILL AND MUST HAVE IT DRAWN UPAT ONCE THAT HE MIGHT SIGN IT WITHOUT DELAY. HE GAVE CERTAIN CLEARCONCISE DIRECTIONS AND WAITED THERE IN THE OFFICE FOR THREE WHOLEHOURS TILL THE WILL WAS READY FOR HIS SIGNATURE. GOULD AND HIS CLERKWERE THE WITNESSES. MR. LORRAINE INSISTED ON CARRYING THE WILL AWAYWITH HIM. THERE WAS NO TIME TO MAKE A COPY.THEN THAT WAS WHAT BROUGHT UNCLE TO LONDON THE WORDS ESCAPED ALDYTHALMOST UNAWARES.YOU KNEW OF HIS BEING THEREYES I MET HIM MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IN OXFORD STREET. I REMEMBER HE HADA SMALL PACKET IN HIS HAND. HE MADE ME PROMISE TO TELL NO ONE OF MYMEETING HIMHE DID NOT WANT IT TALKED ABOUT AT WOODHAM.AH THAT WAS IT SAID THE LAWYER QUICKLY HE WANTED TO DO IT ON THESLY WITHOUT MY KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HE WAS ASHAMED TO LET MEKNOW THAT HE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND. I HAD PUT THINGS TO HIM AS STRONGLYAS I DARED. BUT WHAT A MISTAKE IT WAS WHY COULD HE NOT HAVE COME TOME HIS OWN LAWYER AND LET ME DRAW UP ANOTHER WILL FOR HIMNOW WHO IS TO SAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF THIS LAST WILL DID HE CHANGE HISMIND A SECOND TIME AND DESTROY IT INTENDING THE FORMER WILL TO STANDOR HAVE WE OVERLOOKED THIS HIS LAST WILL AND IS IT YET TO BE FOUNDTHIS IS A VITAL QUESTION FOR YOU MISS ALDYTH. YOU UNDERSTAND DO YOUNOT THAT THE WILL BY WHICH YOU INHERIT WAS MADE IN JANUARY OF LASTYEAR AND WOULD BE INVALID IF A LATER ONE WERE FOUNDI UNDERSTAND SAID ALDYTH.SHE WAS STARTLED BUT NOT CONFUSED BY THE LAWYERS WORDS. IN A MOMENTHER MIND HAD GRASPED THE WHOLE SITUATION. SHE SAW ALL THAT IT INVOLVEDFOR GUY FOR HERSELF FOR HER MOTHER. A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE HAD BEENREJOICING IN THE POWER HER WEALTH GAVE HER NOW IT SEEMED PROBABLETHAT THE WEALTH HAD NEVER BEEN HERS. WELL SHE HAD BEEN HAPPY WITHOUTRICHES AND SHE COULD BE HAPPY WITHOUT THEM AGAIN. HER MOTHER WOULDFEEL THE CHANGE MOST.FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALDYTH DARED NOT GLANCE TOWARDS HER MOTHER SHEWONDERED THAT NO WORD OR SOUND ESCAPED HER. WHILST THESE THOUGHTS WEREPASSING THROUGH ALDYTHS MIND WITH LIGHTNING SPEED THE LAWYER WENT ONTALKING IN COURTEOUSLY REGRETFUL TONES.IT IS MUCH TO BE DEPLORED THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY QUESTION AS TOTHE VALIDITY OF THE WILL. MR. LORRAINE OUGHT TO HAVE ACQUAINTED USEWITH HIS INTENTIONS. IT IS A VERY AWKWARD THING WHEN A LATER WILL ISDISCOVERED AFTER ONE HAS BEEN PROVED AND PUT INTO EXECUTION. MR.GOULD AVERS THAT THIS LATER WILL BEQUEATHED WYNDHAM AND MOST OF THEPROPERTY TO MR. GUY LORRAINE HE NATURALLY IS MUCH EXCITED BY THEINTELLIGENCE. I TOLD HIM I WAS SURE YOU WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO MYINSTITUTING A THOROUGH SEARCH FOR THE MISSING DOCUMENT.ALDYTHS MIND HAD TAKEN A NEW FLIGHT DURING HIS DELIBERATE UTTERANCES.SHE WAS RECALLING THE WORDS HER UNCLE HAD SAID TO HER AS THEY SATTOGETHER IN HYDE PARK RECALLING TOO THE DREAR HOUR WHEN SHE STOOD BYHIS BEDSIDE AND HE HAD VAINLY STRIVEN TO SAY TO HER SOMETHING WHICHWAS BELIEVED TO HAVE REFERENCE TO HIS WILL.UNCLE DID NOT DESTROY THAT WILL SHE EXCLAIMED ALOUD IN A TONE OFCONVICTION IT WILL BE FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOUSE I FULLY BELIEVE.SEARCH FOR IT BY ALL MEANSSEARCH EVERYWHERE. HOW I WISH WE HAD KNOWNOF IT BEFOREAN EXCLAMATION FROM MR. GREENWOOD STARTLED HER.SHE TURNED TO SEE HER MOTHER FALLING IN A FAINTING FIT TO THE FLOOR.DURING THE NEXT TWO HOURS ALDYTH HAD NO THOUGHT OF ANY ONE SAVE HERMOTHER. MRS. STANTON RECOVERED FROM ONE SWOON ONLY TO SINK BACK INTOANOTHER. HER CONDITION WAS SO ALARMING THAT A MESSENGER WAS DESPATCHEDWITH ALL HASTE TO SEEK THE DOCTOR.MR. GREENWOOD LINGERED IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO GOOR TO STAY AND MAKING VAIN OFFERS OF SERVICE TO EVERY ONE WHO CAME INHIS WAY TILL GLADYS TOOK PITY ON HIM AND MANAGED TO GET FROM ALDYTHTHE KEYS OF THE LIBRARY AFTER WHICH HE FOUND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION.THE MEDICAL MAN APPEARED TO THINK SERIOUSLY OF MRS. STANTONSCONDITION. HE INQUIRED IF SHE HAD SUSTAINED ANY SHOCK THAT COULDACCOUNT FOR IT. IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED SHOCK ALDYTH SAID BUT SHEHAD HEARD WHAT MIGHT WELL CAUSE HER ANXIETY. PERHAPS HE SUGGESTED ITWAS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF MENTAL DISTURBANCESTHE LAST STRAW OF THEPROVERB. THE SYMPTOMS INDICATED A SHATTERED CONDITION OF THE NERVESAND A COMPLETE PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH. ALDYTH COULD NOT SAY THAT HERMOTHER HAD OF LATE HAD GREAT WORRIES BUT SHE HAD CERTAINLY FOR SOMETIME SEEMED RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY AND DOUBTLESS THE LOSS OF HER HUSBANDAND THE RUIN OF HIS FIRM WERE SUFFICIENT CAUSE.IT WAS EVENING ERE ALDYTH FOUND LEISURE TO GO DOWN STAIRS AND SEEWHAT MR. GREENWOOD WAS DOING. SHE FOUND HIM IN THE LIBRARY. HE HADTHOROUGHLY RANSACKED THE BUREAU AND IN DOING SO HAD DISCOVERED THESECRET RECESS.LOOK HE SAID AS HE POINTED IT OUT TO HER. THIS WAS WHAT LED ME TOTHE DISCOVERY. THE THIRD DRAWER WAS UNLOCKED IT WOULD NOT QUITE CLOSE.I SEARCHED FOR THE CAUSE AND SAW THIS BIT OF WHITE STUFF CAUGHT ATTHE BACK. PULLING OUT THE DRAWER TO FREE IT I SAW A LITTLE NICK INTHE WOOD WHICH LET ME INTO THE SECRET OF THE HOLLOW BEYOND. NOW THATPIECE OF STUFF WAS NEVER WORN BY STEPHEN LORRAINE. SOME ONE HAS BEENPRYING HERE. WAS IT ONE OF THE SERVANTS DO YOU THINKNO SAID ALDYTH. MRS. ROGERS KEPT THE KEYS SHE WOULD NOT LET ONE OFTHE SERVANTS HAVE THEM AND MY TRUST IN HER IS ABSOLUTE.YES SAID THE LAWYER WITH A RATHER DUBIOUS AIR.ALDYTH BENT TO EXAMINE THE FRAGMENT OF LINEN. IT WAS OF THE FINESTLAWN APPARENTLY TORN FROM A FRILL SUCH AS HER MOTHER HAD BEEN WONTTO WEAR IN THE SLEEVES OF HER CRAPE GOWN. ALDYTHS COLOUR ROSE WITHTHE THOUGHT. VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO HER MIND.SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY IT WAS BUT FROM THAT MOMENT THE IDEATHAT HER MOTHER WAS CONCEALING SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE LATER WILL TOOKPOSSESSION OF ALDYTHS MIND AND REFUSED TO BE DISLODGED. SHE TURNED TOMR. GREENWOOD SPEAKING RATHER TREMULOUSLYMRS. ROGERS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS I FEEL CERTAIN BUT I WILLMAKE INQUIRIES I WILL TRY TO ASCERTAIN IF ANY ONE HAS BEEN TO THEBUREAU.IT WILL BE WELL TO DO SO HE REPLIED.WILL YOU SEARCH FURTHER TONIGHT SHE ASKED.NO NOT NOW. I MUST BE GETTING HOME HE SAID.YOU WILL HAVE SOME DINNER BEFORE YOU STARTNO THANK YOU I MUST NOT STAY. MRS. GREENWOOD WILL BE EXPECTING ME. ISHALL BE OUT AGAIN IN A DAY OR TWO. MRS. STANTON WILL BE BETTER THEN ITRUST.I HOPE SO ALDYTH SAID. BUT I FEEL UNEASY HER PULSE IS SO HIGH.IT WAS INDEED MANY DAYS ERE MRS. STANTON COULD BE PRONOUNCED ON THE WAYTO RECOVERY. SHE DEVELOPED A KIND OF LOW FEVER AND THOUGH HER LIFE WASNEVER IN ACTUAL DANGER HER CONDITION WAS SUCH THAT ALDYTH SUFFEREDMUCH ANXIETY.PART OF THE TIME SHE WAS DELIRIOUS AND THE WORDS SHE UTTERED IN HERDELIRIUM SEEMED TO CONFIRM THE PAINFUL IMPRESSION ALDYTH HAD RECEIVED.SOMETHING EVIDENTLY WEIGHED ON THE MIND OF THE PATIENT SOMETHING SHEWAS ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL.WAS IT A WRONG DONE TO GUY THAT HIS NAME WAS SO OFTEN ON HERLIPS UTTERED IN TONES OF AVERSION AND DREAD WHAT WAS IT THAT SHEPERSISTENTLY DECLARED TO BE NO CRIME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCESCRIME THE WORD THRILLED ALDYTH WITH HORROR. COULD IT POSSIBLY BE THATHER MOTHER HAD DESTROYED THE WILL BY WHICH GUY SHOULD HAVE INHERITEDWYNDHAM ALDYTH COULD NOT SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN THE IDEA AND YET THEFEAR HAUNTED HER. MISERABLE WAS HER ANXIETY AND SUSPENSE AS SHE WATCHEDBESIDE HER MOTHERS BED PERFORMING EVERY DUTY WITH THE TENDEREST CARE.THE VERY THOUGHT OF HER INHERITANCE HAD BECOME A TORTURE TO HER. WHATIF SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO THE HOME SHE OCCUPIED WHAT IF SHE WERE DAILYSPENDING MONEY THAT WAS NOT HERSMEANWHILE SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE IN EVERY POSSIBLEAND IMPOSSIBLE PLACE FOR THE MISSING WILL. ONLY THE SICKROOM HAD NOTBEEN SEARCHED. ALDYTH LONGED FOR THE DAY WHEN SHE MIGHT SATISFY HERSELFWITH REGARD TO THAT BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO LOOKTHROUGH DRAWERS AND CUPBOARDS WITHOUT HER MOTHERS PERMISSION.THE FEVER PASSED BUT LEFT THE PATIENT SO REDUCED IN STRENGTH THAT HERPROGRESS TOWARDS CONVALESCENCE WAS OF THE SLOWEST. MIND AS WELL AS BODYWAS SADLY DEPRESSED. ALDYTH DID NOT NEED THE DOCTORS HINT TO CONVINCEHER THAT THERE WAS A BURDEN ON HER MOTHERS MIND WHICH RETARDED HERRECOVERY.IN VAIN ALDYTH TRIED TO DISCOVER ITS NATURE. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVEHELP WHILST CONFIDENCE WAS RESOLUTELY WITHHELD. MRS. STANTON NEVERALLUDED TO THE LAWYERS VISIT NOR INQUIRED THE RESULT OF HIS SEARCH.SHE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT YET ALDYTH FELT SURE THAT SHEHAD NOT. WAS NOT THIS THE CAUSE OF HER DEEPDRAWN SIGHS HER WEARYMOVEMENTS AND THE SLEEPLESSNESS WHICH DEFIED THE DOCTORS DRUGSONE WARM AFTERNOON MRS. STANTON LAY ON THE COUCH IN HER BEDROOM.WE SHALL SOON HAVE YOU DOWN STAIRS NOW MAMMA ALDYTH HAD SAID ASSHE HELPED HER INTO HER DRESSINGGOWN.BUT HER MOTHER ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND SIGHED. THE THOUGHT OF RESUMINGHER OLD LIFE WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HER. SHE HAD TAKEN A DISLIKE TOWYNDHAM AND HER STRONGEST DESIRE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WAS TO ESCAPEFROM THE PLACE. YET HER HEART CLUNG TO THE COMFORTS AND LUXURIES WHICHALDYTHS INHERITANCE HAD SECURED FOR HER.IT IS VERY WARM SHE MURMURED PRESENTLY. WHERE IS THAT PALMLEAFFAN ALDYTH IT IS LIGHTER TO HOLD THAN THIS ONE.I COULD NOT FIND IT YESTERDAY ALDYTH REPLIED PERHAPS IT IS IN THEWARDROBE.SHE OPENED THE DOORS AS SHE SPOKE.THE NEXT MINUTE MRS. STANTON SAW WITH A THRILL OF DREAD THAT ALDYTHHAD MOUNTED A CHAIR AND WAS SEARCHING ON THE TOP SHELF OF THEWARDROBE. A HECTIC COLOUR SUDDENLY GLOWED IN THE CHEEKS OF THE INVALIDHER VOICE WAS SHARP TO SHRILLNESS AS SHE EXCLAIMEDWHAT ARE YOU DOING ALDYTH YOU WILL NOT FIND IT THERE. COME DOWN ATONCE YOU KNOW I CANNOT BEAR PEOPLE TO TURN OVER MY THINGS.STARTLED BY HER MOTHERS MANNER ALDYTH SPRANG DOWN. WHY MAMMA IWAS DOING NO HARM SHE SAID THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHING ON THAT SHELFEXCEPT YOUR TRAVELLING DESK.A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH MRS. STANTONS WEAKENED FRAME. SHE WAS ASHAMED TOMEET HER DAUGHTERS EYES FULL OF WONDER AT HER EXCESSIVE AGITATION.ALDYTHS GLANCE WAS PENETRATING SHE HALF READ HALF GUESSED THE CAUSEOF THAT AGITATION. HENCE HER NEXT REMARKMAMMA I MAY SOON HAVE TO ASKYOU TO LET ME LOOK THROUGH YOUR WARDROBE AND DRAWERS.WHAT DO YOU MEANI PROMISED MR. GREENWOOD I WOULD LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR THAT WILL.

THEN SHE RALLIED HERSELF TO UTTER THE RETORTWHAT RIGHT HAS HE OR ANY ONE TO SUPPOSE THAT IT CAN BE AMONGST MYTHINGS THAT WARDROBE CONTAINS ONLY WHAT IS MINE.HE SUPPOSES NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID ALDYTH I ONLY WANT FOR MYOWN SATISFACTION TO BE ABLE TO ASSURE HIM THAT THE WILL IS NOWHERE INTHE HOUSE.MRS. STANTONS LIPS MOVED BUT NO SOUND PASSED THEM. SHE COULD NOTUTTER THE UNTRUE WORD. SOMETHING WITHIN HER SAID THAT IT WAS VAIN TOSTRUGGLE LONGER FURTHER CONCEALMENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. YET SHE SHRANKFROM THE DISCLOSURE THAT MUST BE MADE.MOTHER DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS WILLMRS. STANTON COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND BURST INTO TEARS.MAMMA THEN IT IS SO.

IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY FOROTHERS TO KNOW BUT I MUST INSIST UPON GUYS BEING TOLD ALL.YOU ARE UNKIND TO ME ALDYTH CRIED HER MOTHER PASSIONATELY. YOU DONOT CARE HOW MUCH I SUFFER.THE WORDS SMOTE ALDYTH. WAS HER PROUD SENSE OF THE WRONG DONE TOHERSELF AS WELL AS TO GUY RENDERING HER PITILESS SHE REMEMBERED HERMOTHERS WEAKNESS HER RECENT ILLNESS AND THE DOCTORS FEAR OF ARELAPSE ALL THE SUFFERING WHICH HER SIN HAD CAUSED HER. SHE WENT BACKAND SPOKE IN A SOFTER TONE AS SHE BENT OVER HER MOTHER.FORGIVE ME MAMMA IF I SEEM HARSH AND CRUEL. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHATTHIS IS TO ME. I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE HAD YOU ACT SO. BUT ITCANNOT BE HELPED NOW AND YOU HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY. IT ONLY REMAINSFOR US TO DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO MAKE AMENDS TO GUY. AND WE MUST BEGINBY FULL CONFESSION.

I AM SURE IDID IT FOR THE BEST.ALDYTHS FACE GREW STERN AGAIN.IT CAN NEVER BE WELL TO DO WHAT IS WRONG SHE SAID ABRUPTLY. THENFEELING THAT WORDS WERE OF LITTLE USE SHE LEFT THE ROOM CARRYING THEWILL WITH HER.GLADYS WAS NOT TO BE FOUND SO SHE SENT MRS. ROGERS TO TAKE CARE OF HERMOTHER AND SAT DOWN TO WRITE A FEW LINES TO GUY. THEY WERE QUICKLYWRITTEN AND THE NOTE DESPATCHED.ALDYTH BREATHED MORE FREELY WHEN THIS WAS DONE. SHE WENT TO HER ROOMAND THE FIRST THING WHICH MET HER EYES WAS THE PORTRAIT OF HER MOTHERON WHICH HER AFFECTION HAD FEASTED THROUGH THE LONG YEARS OF ABSENCE.MRS. STANTONS WAN WASTED COUNTENANCE OF TODAY HAD LITTLE RESEMBLANCETO THE LOVELY CONTOUR OF THE PHOTOGRAPH AND NO LESS A CONTRAST DID HERMOTHERS CHARACTER AS ALDYTH NOW KNEW IT PRESENT TO THAT OF THE IDEALMOTHER WHOM ALDYTH HAD WORSHIPPED IN HER HEART THROUGH ALL THOSE YEARS.AH THE PITY OF IT ALDYTHS HEART THROBBED WITH PAIN AS THOSE FANCIESOF THE PAST CAME BACK TO HER RECOGNIZED AS ILLUSIONS.

THE MORE MOMENTOUSNEWS CONCERNING THE INHERITANCE OF WYNDHAM WAS FOR A TIME KNOWN ONLYTO MR. RALPH GREENWOOD AND HIS BROTHER THE BANKER BUT THE LEGALPROCESSES WHICH HAD TO BE TAKEN RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEMATTER A SECRET LONG.GREAT WAS THE EXCITEMENT IT CREATED AMONGST ALDYTHS FRIENDS. THEBLANDS AT FIRST REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS MORE THAN AN IDLERUMOUR BUT THEY SOON HEARD IT CONFIRMED BY ALDYTH HERSELF.YES IT IS TRUE SHE SAID ONE AFTERNOON AS SHE JOINED THE GROUPON THE LAWN IN MRS. BLANDS GARDEN IT IS TRUE I AM NO LONGER THEMISTRESS OF WYNDHAM.IT WAS LATE IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE AFTERNOON WAS WARM AND BRIGHT AS THATON WHICH OUR STORY BEGAN. THE GARDEN WAS STILL GAY WITH FLOWERS THEREWERE EVEN A FEW LATE ROSES TO BE SEEN HERE AND THERE. KITTYS CONCHHAD BEEN WHEELED ON TO THE LAWN AND SHE LAY IN THE SHADE OF AN OLDAPPLETREE.

OH I CANNOT TELL YOU THE GOOD FLOWERS DO ME ICOULD ALMOST SAY THEY TALK TO ME ALDYTH FOR THERE IS A LANGUAGE OFFLOWERS. I DO NOT MEAN THE SILLY MEANINGS SENTIMENTAL PERSONS ATTACH TOCERTAIN FLOWERS.

HE IS ONEOF THE FAMILY NOW SINCE HE IS GOING TO MARRY YOUR SISTER.A QUICK THOUGHT MADE ALDYTH GLANCE AT HILDA. HER FACE SHOWED NO SIGN OFDISTURBANCE. IF THE THOUGHT OF THE APPROACHING WEDDING GAVE HER PAINSHE WAS WELL ABLE TO HIDE THE FEELING. PRESENTLY SHE ROSE AND CALLINGGWEN TO HELP HER WENT INTO THE HOUSE TO PREPARE THE AFTERNOON TEA.KITTYS EYES FOLLOWED HER LOVINGLY AS SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE TO ALDYTHIS NOT HILDA GOOD AND BRAVE NOW I AM SURE SHE MUST FEEL GUYS READYTRANSFERENCE OF HIS AFFECTIONS BUT SHE WILL NOT LET IT DEPRESS HER.OH SHE IS BECOMING A GRAND GIRL.I KNOW A GRANDER SAID ALDYTH BENDING TO KISS HER FRIEND.

YES INDEED IT IS NOT SO BAD ASYOU THINK I WILL NOT BE PERSUADED THAT I AM A PITIABLE OBJECT.ALDYTH SMILED AS SHE TURNED AWAY.A PITIABLE OBJECT INDEED KITTY WAS RATHER ONE TO BE ENVIED. SHE HADLEARNED THE HARDEST LESSON LIFE CAN TEACH USTHAT OF RESIGNATIONAND HAD WON THE PEACE WHICH IS THE REWARD OF SUCH ATTAINMENT. KITTYHAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TALK CLEVERLY ABOUT POETRY SHE HAD SEEMEDINSENSIBLE TO ITS BEAUTIES BUT NOW SHE WAS MAKING OF HER OWN LIFE APOEM.CHAPTER XXXII.THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.ALDYTH I WANT TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU SAID GLADYS THAT NIGHTFOLLOWING ALDYTH INTO HER ROOM AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO RETIRE TO REST IHOPE YOU ARE NOT VERY SLEEPY.I AM NOT SAID ALDYTH WHO OF LATE HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO WOO SLEEP WITHNO HAPPIER RESULT THAN USUALLY ATTENDS SUCH WOOINGS LET US TALK BYALL MEANS.SHE DREW FORWARD THE EASIEST CHAIR FOR GLADYS WHO WAS NEVERINDIFFERENT TO HER PERSONAL COMFORT THEN SEATED HERSELF BY HERSISTERS SIDE LOOKING DOWN ADMIRINGLY ON THE PRETTY FLOSSY HAIR ANDTHE FLUSHED CHEEK THAT RESTED AGAINST THE CHINTZ CUSHIONS. GLADYSLOOKED SO BRIGHT AND HAPPY. SHE WAS WELL CONTENT WITH THE PROSPECTBEFORE HER.THE GIRL WHO HAD ENTERED WITH ZEST INTO THE GAIETIES OF TOWN LIFEAND WON ADMIRATION IN CROWDED ASSEMBLIES HAD ADAPTED HERSELF WITHREMARKABLE EASE TO A COUNTRY LIFE. SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS CONCERNINGTHE MAN SHE HAD PROMISED TO MARRY BUT SHE HAD A GENUINE AFFECTIONFOR HIM NEVERTHELESS. SHE KNEW HE WAS NOT HEROIC HAD HE BEEN HEWOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE SUITED HER SO WELL. THEY HAD KINDRED TASTESAND GUYS EASY GOOD NATURE COULD BE TRUSTED TO YIELD TO HER WISHESWHEN THEY DID NOT EXACTLY COINCIDE WITH HIS OWN. GLADYS WOULD IN ALLLIKELIHOOD GET HER OWN WAY IN THE FUTURE AS COMPLETELY AS SHE HAD INTHE PAST BUT GUY WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY IN FOLLOWING HER LEAD. ALDYTHSAW THIS WITH SATISFACTION.I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH GUY ABOUT YOUR HOME ALDYTH GLADYS SAIDAND HE AGREES WITH ME THAT IT MUST NOT BE GIVEN UP. HE SAYS THAT ASLONG AS THE PLAN WORKS WELL AND THE GIRLS BEHAVE THEMSELVES THECOTTAGE SHALL BE USED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE.ILLUSTRATIONTHAT IS VERY GOOD OF GUY AND GOOD OF YOU GLADYS SAID ALDYTHFLUSHING WITH PLEASURE. THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TOMAINTAIN THIS COUNTRY HOME FOR HER WORKING GIRLS HAD CAUSED HER MUCHREGRET.IT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL I SHALL NEVER BE GOOD LIKE YOU ALDYTH THOUGHI MEAN TO TRY SAID GLADYS WISTFULLY. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW YOUMANAGE AND I WILL TRY TO DO ALL I CAN FOR THE GIRLS. AND IF YOU WILLGIVE ME THE ADDRESS I WILL SEND SOME FLOWERS TO LONDON WHENEVER THEYARE SUFFICIENTLY PLENTIFUL.OH THANK YOU SAID ALDYTH DELIGHTED. THAT IS VERY KIND. YOU SHALLCOME WITH ME TO THE COTTAGE TOMORROW IF YOU LIKE AND I WILL SHOW YOUTHE LITTLE THINGS I ALWAYS LOOK AFTER MYSELF. BUT THE CHIEF THING ISTO SPEAK A KIND WORD TO THE GIRLS AND MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY HAVE AFRIEND IN YOU. THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT.NOT TO YOU PERHAPS BUT I DOUBT IF I CAN ACT SUCH A PART SAIDGLADYS SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS.DONT ACT IT BE IT SAID ALDYTH. BEGIN TO SERVE AND YOU WILL SOONFIND IT EASY TO LOVE THOSE YOU SERVE.SHALL I SAID GLADYS. WELL I MEAN TO TRY. YOU HAVE OFTEN MADE MEFEEL HOW SELFISH AND USELESS A LIFE I LEDYOU AND KITTY BLAND. I AMASHAMED OF MYSELF WHEN I SEE KITTY SO BRAVE AND CHEERFUL THINKING EVEROF OTHERS.YOU ARE LEARNING TO THINK OF OTHERS ALDYTH SAID.I HOPE SO GLADYS SAID BUT PERHAPS IT IS ONLY A WHIM OF MINE AND ISHALL FALL BACK INTO THE OLD WAYS AFTER A BIT.YOU MUST NOT LET IT BE A WHIM GLADYS.ILL TRY MY BEST SAID GLADYS BUT ALDYTH I HOPE YOU WILL STILL BEABLE TO DO A GOOD DEAL FOR THE HOME YOURSELF. I HOPE YOU WILL NOT GOFAR OFF. HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHERE YOU AND MAMMA WILL LIVENOT THE LEAST SAID ALDYTH.SHE HAD TRIED MORE THAN ONCE TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT WITH HER MOTHERBUT MRS. STANTON HAD ALWAYS EVADED IT.WELL PERHAPS IT IS BEST TO LEAVE IT FOR THE PRESENT GLADYS SAID.YOU MUST COME AND SEE ME VERY OFTEN. I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP IF I AM TOBECOME A BETTER WOMAN.IT IS NOT MY HELP YOU WANT GLADYS. THE SECRET OF A TRUE LIFE IS TO BEFOUND HERE AND GOD WILL GIVE HIS HELP TO ALL WHO ASK IT.AS SHE SPOKE ALDYTH LAID HER HAND ON THE SMALL NEATLYBOUND COPY OFTHE NEW TESTAMENT THAT LAY ON HER TABLE. GLADYSS FACE GREW STRANGELYGRAVE. THERE WAS AN EARNEST LOOK IN HER BLUE EYES AS SHE TURNED THEMON ALDYTH. FOR A FEW MINUTES NEITHER SPOKE. THEN GLADYS ROSE TO SAYGOODNIGHT. NO OTHER WORD WAS SPOKEN BUT THE HEART OF EACH WASTHRILLED WITH A NEW HAPPINESS AS THEY CLASPED EACH OTHER WARMLY ERETHEY PARTED.A FEW DAYS LATER ALDYTH HER MOTHER AND SISTER WERE IN LONDON. VISITSTO SHOPS DRESSMAKERS AND MILLINERS FILLED UP MOST OF THEIR TIME.MRS. STANTON HAD AGREED WITH ALDYTH AS TO THE NECESSITY OF MAKINGTHE PREPARATIONS FOR GLADYSS WEDDING AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE BUT ITWAS EVIDENT THAT HER IDEA OF SIMPLICITY DIFFERED WIDELY FROM THAT OFALDYTH. SHE WAS DRIVEN TO WONDER UNEASILY HOW THE BILLS WERE TO BE METWHICH HER MOTHER RAN UP WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION. SHE COULD NOT BUTBE AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER FOR HER MOTHER TOKEEP HER EXPENDITURE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE SMALL INCOME THAT WAS ALLALDYTH COULD NOW COMMANDTHE INTEREST OF THE SIX THOUSAND POUNDS HERUNCLE HAD BEQUEATHED TO HER IN HIS LATER WILL.ALDYTH WAS MET BY MANY PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES AS SHE TRIED TO PLAN OUTTHEIR FUTURE. WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH NELLY SHE WOULD LEAVE SCHOOLAT CHRISTMAS BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND IN NO WAY SUITED TO TAKE THEPOST OF A GOVERNESS. THERE SEEMED NO POSSIBILITY NOW OF HER HAVING THEART TRAINING ON WHICH HER HEART WAS SET. GUY HAD PROMISED TO EXTENDA HELPING HAND TO CECIL TILL HE COULD STAND ALONE BUT IT WAS NOT TOBE EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR NELLY. THE MAIN BURDEN OFANXIETY SEEMED TO REST ON ALDYTH. MRS. STANTON COMPLAINED AND LAMENTEDBUT NEVER REALLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE. AND WHILST ALDYTHWORRIED HERSELF OVER WAYS AND MEANS HER MOTHER CALMLY DECIDED THAT THESTATE OF HER HEALTH RENDERED IT IMPERATIVE THAT THEY SHOULD SPEND A FEWWEEKS AT BRIGHTON BEFORE THEY RETURNED TO WYNDHAM.IT WAS WHILST AT BRIGHTON THAT ALDYTH TAKING UP THE TIMES ONEMORNING SAW AN ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH THRILLED HER HEART WITH SYMPATHETICPAIN. MRS. GLYNNE WAS DEAD. ALDYTH HAD NOT KNOWN HER BUT HER AUNTSACCOUNT OF HER OLD FRIEND AND HER SIMPLE HAPPY HOME AT HIGHGATE ASWELL AS JOHN GLYNNES WORDS RESPECTING HIS MOTHER HAD CONVEYED TO HERMIND A VERY VIVID IMPRESSION. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE LOSING A PERSONALFRIEND. IT GRIEVED HER TO THINK OF THE SORROW OF THE BEREAVED. WHATA BLOW IT WOULD BE TO JOHN GLYNNE WAS THE MAIL CARRYING HIM THEMELANCHOLY NEWS OR HAD HE HEARD OF HIS MOTHERS CRITICAL STATE INTIME TO HASTEN TO HER SIDE AND RECEIVE HER LAST FAREWELL HIS QUIETUNDEMONSTRATIVE DEMEANOUR HID A HEART OF RARE WARMTH AND TENDERNESS.ALDYTH KNEW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE STRENGTH OF HISLOVE FOR HIS MOTHER AND HOW DEEPLY HE WOULD FEEL PARTING WITH HER. SHELONGED FOR FULLER INFORMATION THAN WAS AFFORDED BY THE BARE NEWSPAPERPARAGRAPH BUT THE LONGING REMAINED UNSATISFIED FOR STRANGE TO SAYMISS LORRAINE IN HER LETTERS MADE NO ALLUSION TO HER FRIENDS DEATH.TOWARDS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALDYTH WAS AGAIN AT WYNDHAM AND ERE THEMONTH WAS OUT GLADYSS WEDDING TOOK PLACE. A SIMPLE WEDDING IT WASSAID TO BE BUT IT WAS A SIMPLICITY WHICH REQUIRED THE RICHEST WHITESATIN AND THE DAINTIEST ETCTERAS. MRS. STANTON COULD NEVER HAVEFORGIVEN HERSELF IF SHE HAD ALLOWED GLADYS TO BE MARRIED IN A COMMONFASHION.THE GOOD PEOPLE AT WOODHAM APPRECIATED THE SPECTACLE PREPARED FOR THEIRDELECTATION AND MANY WERE OF OPINION THAT A HANDSOMER BRIDEGROOM OR APRETTIER BRIDE HAD NEVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE PARISH CHURCH.ALDYTH AND NELLY WERE THE BRIDESMAIDS AND LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY WELL INTHEIR CREAM CASHMERE AND ROSE COLOUR. BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPRESSIVEFIGURE IN THE LITTLE GROUP GATHERED IN THE CHANCEL WAS THAT OF MRS.STANTON. THE STRONG SEA AIR HAD DRIVEN AWAY EVERY TRACE OF HER ILLNESSHER FINE FORM HER HANDSOME FEATURES HER MASSES OF SILVERY HAIR HADNEVER LOOKED MORE IMPOSING AND SHE BORE HERSELF WITH EVEN MORE THEMHER USUAL GRACE AND DIGNITY. ROBED IN SILVERGREY SILK AND WEARING ABONNET OF THE SAME DELICATE HUE IT WAS REMARKED THAT SHE LOOKED ALMOSTLIKE A BRIDE HERSELF. PERHAPS IT WAS SOON TO LAY ASIDE HER WIDOWSMOURNING BUT A DAUGHTERS WEDDING WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL OCCURRENCE.THE CHURCH BELLS CLANGED JOYOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT BY FOUROCLOCK THE EXCITEMENT AT WYNDHAM WAS OVER AND THE HAPPY PAIR HADDRIVEN AWAY TO CATCH THE LONDON EXPRESS. THE USUAL SENSE OF BLANKNESSWHICH FOLLOWS THE DEPARTURE OF THE BRIDE MADE ITSELF FELT. ALDYTHSTROVE WITH THE FEELING BUT IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THE PARTINGWITH HER SISTER AND THE ENDING OF HER BRIEF EXPERIENCE OF HOME LIFESHOULD CAUSE HER KEEN REGRET. NO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE HAD AS YET BEENDETERMINED ON. THE TIME HAD COME WHEN HER MOTHER COULD NO LONGER REFUSETO DISCUSS THE MATTER. SOMETHING MUST BE DECIDED.NOT TILL NIGHT CAME COULD ALDYTH SECURE A QUIET TALK WITH HER MOTHER. AFEW OF THE GUESTS WERE PERSUADED TO SPEND THE EVENING AT THE HALL. MR.GREENWOOD AND MISS LORRAINE WERE THE LAST TO LEAVE THE BANKER HAVINGOFFERED THAT LADY A SEAT IN HIS BROUGHAM. MISS LORRAINE DREW HER NIECEASIDE FOR A MOMENT IN THE HALL.AH ALDYTH SHE SAID TENDERLY I CAN SEE HOW YOU FEEL LOSING GLADYSANDALL THESE CHANGES. BUT YOU WILL TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS ANDREMEMBER THERE IS ALWAYS A HOME FOR YOU WITH ME WHENEVER YOU WANT ONE.ALDYTH SMILED AND THANKED HER BUT SHE WONDERED AT HER AUNTS WORDS.HOW COULD SHE WANT A HOME HER HOME MUST BE WITH HER MOTHER AND SHEHARDLY SUPPOSED THAT MISS LORRAINE WOULD BE WILLING TO RECEIVE THEMBOTH FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD.BUT THE FUTURE WAS TO TAKE A FORM OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED.AS SOON AS THE GUESTS WERE GONE MRS. STANTON DISMISSED NELLY TO BEDTHEN CALLING ALDYTH TO HER SHE SAID WITH RATHER A NERVOUS SMILELET US HAVE A TALK ALDYTH. NOW THE WEDDING IS OVER WE CAN THINK OFOUR OWN AFFAIRS.WILLINGLY SAID ALDYTH STIRRING UP THE FIRE AND PREPARING FOR A COSYTIME. HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO LIVE MAMMAWELL HARDLY SAID MRS. STANTON FINGERING NERVOUSLY THE GOLDBRACELET WHICH ADORNED HER ARM. TO TELL THE TRUTH SOME ONE HASTHOUGHT OF THAT FOR ME. YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I HAVETO TELL YOU.YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING TO MELBOURNE AGAIN ASKED ALDYTH THETHOUGHT SUGGESTING ITSELF THAT HER MOTHER MIGHT WISH TO RETURN TO THEPLACE WHERE SO MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED AND WHERE WASHER LATE HUSBANDS GRAVE.OH NO SAID MRS. STANTON QUICKLY WHAT COULD MAKE YOU SAY THAT ISUPPOSE IT IS MY FATE TO LIVE AT WOODHAM FOR THE FACT IS ALDYTH I AMGOING TO MARRY MR. GREENWOOD.MAMMAYES IT IS TRUE. OF COURSE YOU ARE SURPRISED. I FELT CERTAIN YOU WOULDBE. BUT I BELIEVE I AM ACTING FOR THE BEST.ALDYTH WAS MORE THAN SURPRISED SHE WAS ASTOUNDED. SHE COULD HARDLYBELIEVE HER EARS. AND YET PERHAPS SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MUCHSURPRISED. MR. GREENWOOD HAD BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR AT WYNDHAM THEYHAD SEEN MUCH OF HIM AT BRIGHTON SHE HAD OFTEN THOUGHT WITH PITYOF HIS DREARY LIFE IN THAT LARGE EMPTY HOUSE. SHE HAD HEARD PEOPLESAY THAT HE WOULD DO WELL TO MARRY AGAIN. NO IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHERSURPRISING STILL THE POSSIBILITY OF HER MOTHERS CONTRACTING A THIRDMARRIAGE HAD NEVER CROSSED HER MIND.HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO ME ALDYTHI HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY MAMMA I AM SO SURPRISED.IT IS SURELY NOT AN UNHEARDOF THING SAID MRS. STANTON IN ANAGGRIEVED TONE. YOU MIGHT BE GLAD. MR. GREENWOOD IS SO KIND SOGENEROUS. HE IS MOST ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE US ALL INTO HIS HOME. HE ISVERY FOND OF YOU. HE SAID ESPECIALLY THAT HE HOPED YOU WOULD LIVETHERE.HE IS VERY KIND BUT I COULD NOT DO THAT SAID ALDYTH QUICKLY.THE BANKER WAS HER DEAR OLD FRIEND YET SHE FELT A SINGULAR DISLIKE TOTHE IDEA SUGGESTED.WHY NOT ASKED HER MOTHER WITH A FROWN.

MR.GREENWOOD WILL GIVE HER EVERY ADVANTAGE. SHE WILL BE ABLE TO PAINT TOHER HEARTS CONTENT.YES IT MIGHT PROVE A HAPPY THING FOR NELLY. ALDYTH COULD SEE THAT SHECOULD SEE ALL THE ATTRACTIONS THAT THIS NEW SCHEME OF THE FUTURE MUSTHAVE FOR HER MOTHER. PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO BE GLAD BUT SHE COULD NOT BEGLAD YET SHE WAS HALFSTUNNED AND THERE WAS A DULL PAIN AT HER HEART.ARE YOU VEXED ABOUT IT ALDYTHNO MAMMA NOT VEXED I THINK BUT I CANT GET OVER MY SURPRISE ALL ATONCE.YOU WILL HARDLY GET OVER IT I FEAR BEFORE THE PROSPECT IS REALIZEDSAID HER MOTHER WITH RATHER A FORCED LAUGH IT WOULD BE FOOLISH INOUR CASE TO MAKE MUCH TO DO ABOUT IT. WE ARE TO BE MARRIED IN LONDONIN THREE WEEKS TIME AND SHALL SPEND THE WINTER IN THE SOUTH OFFRANCE. MR. GREENWOOD THINKS THAT AFTER MY ILLNESS I SHOULD NOT RISKTHE COLD OF WOODHAM. I TOLD GLADYS OF OUR PLANS BUT I THOUGHT YOU HADBETTER NOT KNOW TILL HER WEDDING WAS OVER.MRS. STANTON SPOKE RAPIDLY BEING ANXIOUS TO GET THROUGH WITH ALL ITWAS NECESSARY TO SAY.ALDYTH HEARD HER WITH INCREASED ASTONISHMENT AND SOME BITTERNESS OFFEELING. WHILST SHE HAD BEEN BURDENED WITH ANXIETY FOR THE FUTURE THISPLAN HAD BEEN HER MOTHERS CHERISHED SECRET. IT WAS A PLAN IN WHICH SHEHAD NO PART. HER MOTHERS MARRIAGE IT SEEMED TO HER MUST EXCLUDE HERTO A GREAT EXTENT FROM HER MOTHERS LIFE. SHE WAS NO LONGER TO BE HERMOTHERS GUARDIAN SHE WOULD HARDLY BE NEEDED BY HER MOTHER NOW. SHEFELT THAT SHE WAS THRUST ON ONE SIDE.WILL YOU NOT KISS ME AND WISH ME HAPPINESS ASKED MRS. STANTON WHENTHE SILENCE BETWEEN THEM WAS GROWING PAINFUL.CERTAINLY MAMMA I WISH YOU HAPPINESS NOW AND ALWAYS SAID ALDYTHKISSING HER GRAVELY.THEN SHE WENT AWAY AND MRS. STANTON BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEFTHANKFUL THAT SHE HAD GOT THROUGH THE DISAGREEABLE TASK OF TELLINGALDYTH.ALDYTH PROFITED BY HER AUNTS ADVICE AND TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OFTHIS MOST UNEXPECTED TURN OF AFFAIRS. SHE HID THE PAIN SHE FELT BEINGAWARE THAT MOST PERSONS WOULD HAVE JUDGED THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE FORPAIN.EVEN MRS. BLAND AND KITTY WHO COULD ENTER INTO HER FEELINGS AS NOOTHER FRIENDS COULD WERE INCLINED TO THINK THE EVENT A FORTUNATE ONEFOR ALDYTH. AS WIFE OF THE WEALTHY BANKER HER MOTHER WOULD HAVE APOSITION ENTIRELY TO HER MIND. SUCH A HOME AS ALDYTHS LIMITED MEANSCOULD PROVIDE WOULD NEVER HAVE PLEASED HER. BUT THEY BREATHED NO HINTOF THIS TO ALDYTH. THEY KNEW TOO WELL HOW HER HEART CLUNG TO HER MOTHERWITH A LOVE WHICH STILL IN SPITE OF EVERY SHOCK IT HAD MET STROVETO EXCUSE AND IF POSSIBLE VEIL HER COLD SELFISHNESS AND SAD LACK OFPRINCIPLE.NELLY RECEIVED THE NEWS CHEERFULLY. SHE LIKED MR. GREENWOOD AND COULDLOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW HOME LIFE. SHE WAS CHARMED TO FIND THAT HERFUTURE STEPFATHER SHARED HER ENTHUSIASM FOR ART AND DELIGHTED BEYONDMEASURE WHEN HE PROMISED THAT SHE SHOULD STUDY AT SOUTH KENSINGTON. ITWAS ARRANGED THAT SHE SHOULD AT ONCE BE ENROLLED AS A STUDENT IN THEART SCHOOL AND SHOULD RESIDE WITH FRIENDS IN LONDON TILL MR. AND MRS.GREENWOOD RETURNED FROM THEIR SOJOURN ABROAD. AND MISS LORRAINE WITHNO SLIGHT SATISFACTION LOOKED FORWARD TO ALDYTHS AGAIN MAKING HERHOME WITH HER AT MYRTLE COTTAGE.THE NEW YEAR WAS NOT MANY DAYS OLD WHEN ALDYTH RETURNED TO WOODHAM.SHE HAD SEEN HER MOTHER MARRIED AT A WESTEND CHURCH IN ALL THE GLORYOF HER SILVERGREY ROBE SURROUNDED BY A LITTLE KNOT OF WELLWISHINGFRIENDS. SHE HAD BIDDEN HER A HURRIED FAREWELL ERE SHE DROVE AWAYWITH HER HUSBAND TO CHARING CROSS AND THEN ALDYTH AND HER SISTERHAD RETURNED TO THE HOME OF THE FRIENDS WITH WHOM NELLY WAS TO SPENDTHE NEXT FEW MONTHS. ALDYTH HAD YIELDED TO THEIR PERSUASIONS WARMLYSECONDED BY NELLY TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH THEM AND THE SEASON HAD NOTPASSED UNHAPPILY.NOW SHE CAME BACK TO TAKE UP ONCE MORE THE OLD DROPPED THREADS OF HERFORMER LIFE AT WOODHAM.IT SO HAPPENED THAT ALDYTH HAD BEEN UNABLE TO INFORM HER AUNT BY WHATTRAIN SHE WOULD TRAVEL DOWN AND THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE STATION TOMEET HER. IT WAS A CLEAR COLD AFTERNOON AND LEAVING HER LUGGAGE TOBE SENT ON SHE WALKED THE SHORT DISTANCE TO THE COTTAGE. SHE MET NOFRIEND ON THE WAY. THE BLANDS WINDOWS WERE DESERTED BUT MISS TABITHARUDKIN FROM HER POST OF OBSERVATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD SAWHER PASS AND CONNECTED HER ARRIVAL WITH THAT OF ANOTHER VISITOR WHOHAD UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT MISS LORRAINES ON THE PREVIOUS DAY. BUTMISS RUDKIN COULD NOT BELIEVE IN THE FORTUITOUS NATURE OF THE VISIT.SHE WAS NOT SO EASILY HOODWINKED SHE SAID. OF COURSE IT WAS A PLANNEDTHING.ARRIVED AT HER AUNTS GATE ALDYTH PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO GAZE AT THEWIDESTRETCHING PROSPECT SHE LOVED. THE VIEW WAS UNUSUALLY CLEAR. SHECOULD SEE THE LONG ARMS OF A DISTANT WINDMILL RISING BLACK AGAINST THESKY AND THE SPIRE OF WICKHAM CHURCH STANDING FORTH FROM A BACKGROUNDOF PEARLY GREY. OLD THOUGHTS OLD MEMORIES SWEPT BACK UPON HER WITH THESIGHT AND THEIR INFLUENCE WAS SADDENING.                     NATURE NEVER DID BETRAY   THE HEART THAT LOVED HER IT IS HER PRIVILEGE   THROUGH ALL THE YEARS OF THIS OUR LIFE TO LEAD   FROM JOY TO JOYSHE MURMURED TO HERSELF AS SHE ENTERED THE GARDEN BUT THOUGH SHE KNEWTHIS SOURCE OF JOY HER OWN SHE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO REJOICE AT THATMOMENT.THE LITTLE MAID WHO OPENED THE DOOR GAVE A START OF SURPRISE AT SEEINGHER. NOT HAVING BEEN LONG IN MISS LORRAINES SERVICE SHE HARDLY KNEWALDYTH AND WAS DISMAYED AT HER EARLY APPEARANCE.MISS LORRAINE NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE HERE TILL THE EVENING SHESAID SHE WILL NOT BE BACK HERSELF TILL SIX.AND ALDYTH REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS THE AFTERNOON ON WHICH HER AUNT HELDHER MOTHERS MEETING.TO ARRIVE BEFORE ONE IS EXPECTED IS SELDOM A CHEERING EXPERIENCE.ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO HOUSE IN WHICH SHE SHOULD FEEL MORE AT HOME ASENSATION OF DREARINESS AND LONELINESS OPPRESSED ALDYTH AS SHE WENTUP STAIRS TO HER OLD ROOM. THE LITTLE MAID FOLLOWED HER UNEASY ANDAPOLOGETIC.MISTRESS TOLD ME TO LIGHT THE FIRE SHE SAID BUT I DIDNT THINKTHERE WAS ANY HURRY.IT DOES NOT MATTER ALDYTH SAID.BUT THE MAID AT ONCE SET ABOUT THE NEGLECTED DUTY WITH THE RESULT THATTHE ROOM WAS SOON FULL OF SMOKE.ALDYTHS DEPRESSION INCREASED. THE ROOM HAD NOT THE OLD FAMILIARASPECT. SHE MISSED HER BOOKS AND PICTURES WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED TOWYNDHAM WHILST SHE DWELT THERE AND WERE NOW LYING IN A LARGE CHESTWAITING TO BE UNPACKED. SHE WAS FREE TO DEVOTE HERSELF ONCE MORE TO THESTUDIES WHICH SHE LOVED BUT THERE WAS LITTLE JOY IN THE THOUGHT. HERSWAS A NATURE WHICH FINDS ITS HIGHEST FREEDOM IN THE BONDS OF DUTY.IT GRIEVED HER THAT THE TIES THAT FOR A BRIEF PERIOD HAD BOUND HER SOCLOSELY TO HER MOTHER AND SISTERS WERE SNAPPED. THE RAPID CHANGES OFTHE LAST TWO YEARS HAD LEFT HER RESTLESS AND UNSETTLED. THERE SEEMED NOPURPOSE IN HER LIFE NOW. SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW SHE SHOULD SETTLE AGAIN INHER AUNTS HOME.BUT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO BEGIN THUS. SHE FOUGHT WITH HER DESPONDENCYSHE TOOK HERSELF TO TASK. IN A WORLD WHERE SO MANY NEEDED LOVE ANDSYMPATHY WAS THERE NOT WORK FOR EVERY ONE WOULD NOT NEW DUTIES COMETO HER GOD HAD A PURPOSE IN HER LIFE A PLACE FOR HER TO FILL.   I SMILED TO THINK GODS GREATNESS FLOWED AROUND OUR INCOMPLETENESS    ROUND OUR RESTLESSNESS HIS REST.ALDYTH SMILED TOO AS THE WORDS CAME TO MIND. SHE SHOOK OFF HERDISCONTENT WITH THE DUST OF TRAVEL AND HAVING FRESHENED HERAPPEARANCE QUITTED THE SMOKY ROOM AND RAN DOWN STAIRS.THERE A SURPRISE AWAITED HER. THE SERVANT BEWILDERED BY HER SUDDENAPPEARANCE HAD NOT THOUGHT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT MISS LORRAINE HADA GUEST. AS ALDYTH ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM A GENTLEMAN ROSE QUICKLYFROM A CHAIR BY THE FIRE. DID HER EYES DECEIVE HER OR WAS IT INDEEDJOHN GLYNNEYOU ARE COME HE SAID BY NO MEANS SURPRISED TO SEE HER. MISSLORRAINE ASSURED ME YOU WOULD NOT ARRIVE BEFORE SIX OCLOCK. I WASCOMING TO THE STATION TO MEET YOU I AM SORRY TO HAVE MISSED THATPLEASURE.AND ALDYTH HAD HER WELCOME AT LAST BUT IT TOOK HER SOME MINUTES TORECOVER FROM HER ASTONISHMENT.YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON I EXPECTED TO SEE SHE SAID I THOUGHT YOUWERE A LONG WAY OFF.AH YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD RETURNED. I RESIGNED MY POST AND CAME HOMEON ACCOUNT OF MY MOTHERS ILLNESS.THEN YOU WERE WITH HER ALDYTH SAID IN TONES SOFT WITH SYMPATHY.YES I WAS WITH HER. IT IS A GREAT COMFORT TO ME TO REMEMBER THOSELAST DAYS.AND HE TOLD HER ABOUT THEM TALKING AS HE COULD NOT HAVE TALKED TO MISSLORRAINE INDEED TO NO OTHER BEING COULD HE SO HAVE OPENED HIS HEART.ALDYTH SAID LITTLE IN RESPONSE BUT HER SYMPATHY MADE ITSELF FELTWITHOUT WORDS AND THE FEW SHE UTTERED WERE DEAR TO HIM.YOUR SISTER IS WELL I HOPE SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE.QUITE WELL HE ANSWERED SHE IS GOING TO BE MARRIED.THAT WILL BE YOUR LOSS SAID ALDYTH.IT WILL BUT SHE WILL BE HAPPY.ARE YOU GOING ABROAD AGAINNO I HAVE FOUND WORK IN LONDON.ALDYTH MADE NO REMARK ON THIS. SHE WAS SILENT THINKING OF THE EVENINGWHEN THEY HAD PARTED AT THE FIELD GATE AND OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENEDSINCE.AUNT HAS TOLD YOU ALL THE NEWS I SUPPOSE SHE SAID AT LAST. YOUKNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO METHAT MY MOTHER HAS GONE FROM METHAT OURHOME IS BROKEN UPI KNOW HE SAID LOOKING EARNESTLY AT HER YOU FEEL THESE CHANGESVERY MUCHI FEELSOME THINGS ALDYTH REPLIED A STRANGE TREMOR IN HER VOICE. IDONT MIND LOSING WYNDHAM BUT I DO FEEL LOSING MY MOTHER. IT IS HARDTO THINK THAT SHE NO LONGER WANTS METHAT NO ONE WANTS ME NOW.THE WORDS HAD SCARCELY PASSED HER LIPS ERE SHE WOULD HAVE RECALLEDTHEM. THEY SOUNDED SO WEAK SO SELFISH.JOHN GLYNNE DID NOT DEEM THEM SO. THEY SEEMED TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLEWHICH WAS HIS HEARTS MOST CHERISHED DESIRE. HE ROSE HE MOVED TO THEWINDOW AND STOOD THERE IN SILENCE A FEW MOMENTS. THEN HE CAME BACK ANDSTOOD BEFORE ALDYTH. SHE LOOKED UP AND MET HIS GLANCE WHICH HELD HERSSPELLBOUND.ALDYTH I WANT YOU HE SAID.AND SHE GAVE HERSELF TO HIM WITHOUT A FEAR.
