GEORGE PUTNAM HAS ASKED ME TO WRITE A SOLEMN FOREWORD TO DAVIDSBOOK. AN IDEAL FOREWORD CANNOT BE TOO BRIEF SHOULD NEVER BE IN THENATURE OF AN APOLOGY OR A PANEGYRICAND IN FACT ANY DIRECT REFERENCETO THE SUBJECT OF THE VOLUME IN WHICH IT IS PRINTED IS IN THE NATURE OFREDUNDANCY. ITS ONLY USE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS A CHANCE TO EXPLOITSOME IDEA OF THE FOREWORDS AUTHOR WHICH HE CAN FIND NO OPPORTUNITY TOPRINT ELSEWHERE.PRAGMATISM ALONE WAS THE STIMULUS OF MY SUGGESTION THAT ELEVENYEAROLDDAVID PUTNAM GO ON ONE LEG OF THE ARCTURUS EXPEDITIONA SQUEERSIAN ACIDTEST OF SORTS. ALSO A SELFISH DESIRE TO SEE HOW MY BLAS ENTHUSIASMSHAD CHANGED SINCE I THRILLED AT MY FIRST PALM TREE AND MY FIRSTDOLPHIN.I WANTED TO SEE THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF A TEMPORARY SHIFT FROM SCHOOLTO SKYLINE FROM BOOKS TO BOOBIES OF THE PUTTING OF VOLCANOES INTOVACATIONS AND OF THE WORKING OUT OF A SUBLIMATED HOOKY. OF THEIMMEDIATE PERSONAL REACTIONS BETWEEN DAVID MYSELF AND OUR GORGEOUSENVIRONMENT I CAN SPEAK ONLY WITH SHEER ENJOYMENT. NEITHER OF US EVERTIRED OF EXELEUTHEROSTOMIZING AT EVERY NEW THRILL.AS TO THE SIFTING OF ALL THESE IMPRESSIONS THEIR RECLOTHING IN WORDSAND PHRASES I AM LOOKING FORWARD WITH KEEN INTEREST TO READING DAVIDSBOOK WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN GAINED OR LOST INTHIS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE TESTS OF THE WORKING OF A HUMAN MIND.

BEEBE LETS ME CALL HIM UNCLE WILL EVEN IF HE IS THE HEAD OF THISBIG EXPEDITION. HE WAS AWFULLY NICE TO LET ME GO ON PART OF IT.I HAD MY TWELFTH BIRTHDAY ON THE ARCTURUS DOWN ON THE EQUATOR. AND IKNOW HOW LUCKY I WAS TO BE TAKEN ALONG. IT WAS GREAT FUN. AND I THINK ILEARNED A LOT THOUGH PERHAPS IT WILL HURT MY SCHOOL WORK BEING AWAYAND EVERYTHING. ANYWAY MOTHER AND I JOINED THE ARCTURUSUNCLE WILLSSHIPAT PANAMA. WE SPENT NEARLY THREE MONTHS IN THE PACIFIC OCEANSTUDYING SEA LIFE AND VISITING SEVEN UNINHABITED DESERT ISLANDS. AND IPROMISED DAD TO WRITE A LITTLE STORY ABOUT IT ALL. HE TOLD ME TO TRY TOTELL WHAT WE DID AND WHAT I SAW JUST LIKE FELLOWS TELLING EACH OTHERABOUT THEIR ADVENTURES. THATS PRETTY HARD TO DO.THEN WHEN I GOT BACK THEY LET ME MAKE THIS LITTLE BOOK OUT OF WHAT IWROTE MOST EVERY DAY ON THE BOAT. ITS MEANT FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. MOTHERHELPED ME FIX UP THE SPELLING AND MAKE THE GRAMMAR RIGHT.THE WRITING TOOK QUITE A LONG TIME AND I THINK BEING A NATURALISTWOULD BE MORE FUN THAN BEING A WRITER. ANYWAY MY STORIES HELP MEREMEMBER THE FUN WE HAD ON THE ARCTURUS. I DONT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVEBEEN MUCH BETTER.WE ARRIVED IN COLON FROM NEW YORK AND HAVANA EARLY IN THE MORNING OFMARCH TH AND AFTER OUR INSPECTION CAPT. LANE TOOK US IN HIS OWNLAUNCH OVER TO THE ARCTURUSA HIGH WHITE SHIP WHICH WAS LYING ACROSSTHE HARBOR.THIS ARCTURUS THE BOAT ON WHICH WE ARE TO TAKE OUR TRIP IS NAMED FORTHE GREAT STAR WHICH SAILORS USE AS A GUIDING STAR IN SAILING STRANGESEAS. SHE WAS FITTED OUT BY MEN WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE NEW YORKZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY WHICH HAS THE WONDERFUL ZOO IN THE BRONX. AMONG THELIVING ANIMALS COLLECTED FOR THE ZOO ARE ALBATROSSES FLIGHTLESSCORMORANTS A VERY RARE BIRD BOOBIES AND PENGUINS. A GREAT MANYSPECIMENS WERE TO GO TO THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AND FISHTO THE AQUARIUM AT THE BATTERY. SHE IS FITTED WITH A WHOLE OUTFIT FOR ASCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION. AT FIRST SIGHT SHE LOOKED LIKE A FREIGHTER HIGHSIDED AND BUILT FOR CARGO WITH MANY BOOMS AND CABLES AND EQUIPMENT FORHOISTING AND MOVING THINGS.THERE ARE TWO LABORATORIES IN THE FORWARD PART THE LOWER ONE FITTEDWITH BOTTLES MICROSCOPES MODELLING CLAY AND ALL SORTS OF GLASS JARSIN WHICH TO PRESERVE SPECIMENS. THE UPPER ROOM IS MORE OF A LIBRARYWITH REFERENCE BOOKS AND TEXT BOOKS ON ALL SUBJECTS ABOUT OCEANOGRAPHYFOR THIS IS AN EXPEDITION MOSTLY TO STUDY ABOUT THE SEA AND THE STRANGECREATURES IN IT. ALSO THERE IS A CHEMICAL LABORATORY SO THAT THE BLOODOF FISHES CAN BE EXAMINED.THE BRIDGE OR MAIN PART OF THE SHIP IS BUILT UP OF FIVE DECKS ANDTHE MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION HAVE CABINS HERE. THE CREWS SLEEPINGQUARTERS ARE IN THE AFTER PART OF THE SHIP AND MANY OF THE MEN HAVEHAMMOCKS HUNG UP UNDER THE AWNING THERE IN WHICH THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTOR LIE AROUND IN THE DAY TIME.ON THE PORT SIDE OF THE SHIP THERE IS A SPECIAL BOOM THAT GOES OUT OVERTHE SIDE. ON SHIPS THE WORD PORT MEANS LEFT AND STARBOARD MEANSRIGHT. YOU NEVER SAY BACK OR FRONT BUT AFT OR FORWARD.THIS BOOM HAS TWO RAILINGS TIED TO THE BOTTOM PLANK SO ONE CAN WALK OUTTHERE AND FISH OR HAUL IN NETS OR GO DOWN THE ROPE LADDER. SOMETIMESWHEN THE SHIP ROLLS A LOT THE END GOES RIGHT UNDER THE WATER. AND OUTFROM THE BOW A PULPIT IS HUNG A STRONG WIRE CAGELIKE THING IN WHICHWE CAN STAND FOR HARPOONING OR CATCHING FLOATING OBJECTS AS WE PASS. TOGET DOWN TO THE PULPIT YOU CLIMB DOWN A ROPE LADDER. WHEN ITS ROUGHITS PRETTY EXCITING.IN THE FORWARD PART OF THE SHIP THERE ARE TWO ROOMS FITTED OUT ASSHOPS ONE BELONGING TO BILL MERRIAM THE GENERAL HANDY MAN WHO ALWAYSMENDS THE NETS SHAPES A NEW DREDGE PUTS ANOTHER SEAT IN ONE OF THEROWBOATS MAKES A LOBSTER POT OR FIXES THE MOTOR BOATS. THE OTHER IS AWORKSHOP FOR SERGE THE TAXIDERMIST AND FOR DWIGHT FRANKLIN THESCULPTOR. DWIGHT MAKES WAX MOULDS AND PLASTER CASTS OF FISHES ANDPRESERVES THEM AS WELL AS MAKING DRAWINGS AND PAINTINGS.ISABEL COOPER IS THE SCIENTIFIC ARTIST. SHE HAS BEEN ON MANY OTHEREXPEDITIONS AND MADE MANY WONDERFUL PICTURES. ON THIS TRIP SHE DID OVERTWO HUNDRED WATER COLOR DRAWINGS OF FISH.THE ARCTURUS HAS TWO HUGE CABLES ONE SEVEN MILES LONG FOR HAULING INTHE BIG TRAWLS. THESE ARE PUT DOWN OVER THE SIDE AND HELD OUT WHILE THESHIP GOES SLOWLY ALONG AT HALF SPEED. SOMETIMES THE CABLE GOES OUT ASMUCH AS THREE MILES AND OFTEN THE SEA IS OVER A MILE DEEP BELOW US.THERE ARE THIRTYEIGHT IN THE CREW AND EIGHTEEN MEMBERS OF THEEXPEDITION. EACH NIGHT AND MORNING THE NETS ARE PUT OVER FOR A SURFACEHAUL AND FOR A DEEP ONE A SOUNDING IS TAKENA CURIOUS LEAD ON A WIREWEIGHTED DOWN WITH AN IRON WEIGHT WHICH FORCES THE SOUND LEAD DOWN TOTHE SEA BOTTOM AND BRINGS UP A SAMPLE OF THE BOTTOM SO WE CAN SEE IFIT IS MUDDY OR ROCKY OR SANDY. EACH TIME THE WEIGHT AUTOMATICALLY DROPSOFF WHEN THE BOTTOM IS REACHED BECAUSE THE SOUNDING WIRE ISNT STRONGENOUGH TO PULL IT UP.AFTER THE NETS ARE OUT FOR AN HOUR THEY ARE HAULED IN AND THE CONTENTSPUT INTO TUBS OF WATER. SOMETIMES THE WHOLE NET HAS ONLY A PINT GLASSFULL OF TINY TINY FISH WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM A DEPTH OF OVERA MILE OR TWO MILES.ON THE BOAT MY ROOM MATE WAS DR. W. K. GREGORY OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUMOF NATURAL HISTORY WHO IS ALSO PROFESSOR OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY ATCOLUMBIA. PRETTY NICE I THINK FOR A REAL PROFESSOR TO LET ATWELVEYEAROLD BOY BUNK WITH HIM EVERYONE CALLED HIM JUST GREG ANDLIKED HIM A LOT BECAUSE HE ALWAYS IS SO NICE AND SO INTERESTED IN HISWORK. I THINK GREG WOULD RATHER DISSECT A FISH THAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING.I KNOW ID JUST ABOUT RATHER CATCH THEMMY BUNK WAS RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THE SMOKESTACK WENT UP FROM THE ENGINEROOM AND THE WALL WAS PRETTY HOT. SO MOST OF THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN ITRAINED I SLEPT ON DECK. REALLY ALTHOUGH WE CROSSED THE EQUATORTWENTYONE TIMES IT WAS NOT SO HOT WHILE WE WERE AT SEA. LOTS OF TIMESRIGHT ON THE EQUATOR IT WAS COOL ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE WEARING ASWEATER.WE START ON OUR CRUISEFOR A DAY AFTER OUR ARRIVAL ON THE ARCTURUS WE WAITED IN COLON WHILETHE CREW SHIFTED COAL FROM ONE BUNKER TO ANOTHER BECAUSE IT WAS GETTINGSO HOT IN THE FORWARD ONE THERE WAS FEAR OF ITS CATCHING ON FIRE.AND ON THE VERY FIRST DAY WHILE THE REST OF THE CROWD WERE ASHORESEEING THE CITY OF COLON WHICH IS AT THE ATLANTIC ENTRANCE OF THEPANAMA CANAL I WENT WITH SERGE THE RUSSIAN TAXIDERMIST TO A LITTLEBEACH ACROSS THE BAY. WE TOOK NETS WITH US AND WERE LUCKY TO CATCH SOMEWONDERFUL BUTTERFLIES SEVERAL VERY BRIGHT BLUE FISH AND SOME UNUSUALSHELLS.NEXT DAY WE STARTED THROUGH THE CANAL EARLY AND STEAMED ALONG UP TOTHE FIRST LOCK. THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST AND HIGHEST OF ALL THE LOCKSGATUN AND HERE ALSO IS THE GREAT SPILLWAY WHICH EMPTIES OUT INTO THEATLANTIC OCEAN FROM GATUN LAKE. THE CONCRETE WALLS AND THE LITTLERAILROAD ENGINES WHICH PULLED US THROUGH THE LOCKS ALL SEEM SO SIMPLEAND LIKE TOYS THAT YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ABIG SHIP THROUGH. FOR THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO MEN TO BE SEEN THEWHOLE TIME AND ONE IN AN ENGINE HOUSE TURNS A HANDLE AND THE LOCKSOPEN FILL WITH WATER TAKE US IN LIFT US UP AND THEN SET US OUT UPONA HIGHER LEVEL INTO ANOTHER LOCK OR THE LAKE. THE LITTLE ENGINES HAVECOGGED WHEELS AND RUN ALONG UP AND DOWN THE GRADES LIKE TRACTORENGINES.IN SOME OF THE LOCKS WE SAW GARFISH LIKE EELS A LITTLE WITH LONGSHARP BEAKS OR BILLS IN FRONT OF THEIR HEADS. AND AT MANY PLACES ALONGTHE BANK OF THE RIVER OR LAKE WE SAW BIG CROCODILES LYING OUT IN THESUN.IN THE AFTERNOON WE WERE IN PANAMA A CITY BUILT BY THE SPANIARDS WHENTHE FIRST CITY OF OLD PANAMA WAS DESTROYED BY THE GREAT ENGLISH PIRATEMORGAN. WE DROVE OUT TO THIS OLD CITY SIX MILES AWAY. THERE ARE ONLYRUINS THERE NOW BUT THE WALLS OF THE OLD CATHEDRALS STILL STAND ANDTHE SQUARE TOWER CAN BE SEEN VERY FAR AWAY. MORGAN ATTACKED THESPANIARDS HERE AFTER HE HAD CROSSED THE ISTHMUS WITH A FEW HUNDRED MEN.HIS MEN WERE NEARLY STARVED AND WERE WORN OUT WITH THE HARD WORK TO GETACROSS BUT THEY WERE DETERMINED TO TAKE THIS CITY FOR THERE WAS MUCHGOLD AND JEWELS HERE AND THE PIRATES WANTED TO WIN IT. ALSO THESPANIARDS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND AFTER A FIRST DEFEAT IN THE OPENPLAINS OUTSIDE THE CITY THEY RAN AWAY.IN THE SEA WALL AROUND THE NEW CITY OF PANAMA THERE IS A PRISON AND ATONE TIME THERE WERE TERRIBLE TORTURE CHAMBERS AND UNDERSEA DUNGEONSTHERE IN WHICH THE EARLY SPANIARDS KEPT THEIR PRISONERS. IT IS CALLEDCHIRIQUE PRISON.NEXT MORNING WE WERE SAILING ALONG ON THE CALM PACIFIC OCEAN WHICHBALBOA DISCOVERED IN  FROM A HIGH PEAK ON THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA. BYNIGHT TIME WE HAD PUT OVER THE BIG PETERSON TRAWL NET AND HAD BROUGHTIN MANY SMALL FISH ... SALPAS AND MANY KINDS OF TINY DEEP SEA FISH.EVERYBODY RAN TO SEE WHAT WAS IN THE NET AND LOOKED AT THINGS THROUGHMICROSCOPES AND IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN TO IDENTIFY THEM AND CLASSIFYTHEM. ONE PERSON TAKING THE LITTLE FISHLIKE ONES ANOTHER THE JELLYFISH ANOTHER SHRIMPS AND UNCLE WILL THE DIRECTOR TAKING ANYTHINGTHAT WAS VERY UNUSUAL OR A NEW SPECIES.THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE BIG NET WAS PUT OVER WE CAUGHT A LOT OFDIFFERENT THINGS TINY FISH GLACOUS SALPA AND OTHERS. AT NIGHT THEDEEP NET AGAIN BROUGHT IN NEW ONES AND MANY OF THE FIRST ONES AGAINEXCEPT THAT MANY OF THESE SPECIMENS WERE BRIGHT RED. IT IS QUEER BUTMANY OF THE DEEP SEA THINGS ARE RED LIKE THE SHRIMPS OR ELSE HAVE THEPOWER TO CHANGE TO RED LIKE A SMALL SQUID WHICH WAS WHITE ONE MINUTEAND BRIGHT RED THE NEXT WHEN HE SEEMED TO GET ANGRY AND SCURRY AROUND.ONE OF THESE VERY LITTLE FISH NAMED ARGYROPELECUS HAS LOVELY SILVERSIDES BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND SMALL SPOTS WHICH SHINE AND ALMOSTSPARKLE.ANOTHER FISH LESS THAN AN INCH LONG ONEIRODES IS THE ONLY SPECIMENEVER TO HAVE BEEN SEEN ALIVE. IT WAS STILL WIGGLING A LITTLE BIT WHENTHE NET WAS BROUGHT UP. MOST OF THESE FISH DIE WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TOTHE SURFACE FOR UNDER THE WATER THERE IS A GREAT PRESSURE ON THEM ANDWHEN THIS IS RELEASED BY COMING TO THE SURFACE THEY EXPLODE OR ALL COMETO PIECES.ONE NIGHT WE WERE ON THE GANGWAY UNCLE WILL RUTH ROSE SERGE ANDMYSELF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A GREAT BIG SQUID CAME UP AND MADE A KIND OFHAAA. HE TRIED HIS BEST TO TAKE HOLD OF THE NET WITH WHICH SERGETRIED TO GRAB AT HIM AND PUT HIS HUGE TENTACLES OUT OF THE WATER. HEWAS A SICKLY WHITISH COLOR. WHEN WE BROUGHT THE SMALLER ONES CAUGHT INA TRAWL NET INTO THE AQUARIUM LATER HOWEVER THEY CHANGED COLOR SEVERALTIMES TURNING FROM THIS WHITISH TO A BRIGHT RED AS QUICK AS COULD BE.SQUIDS CAN SQUIRT OUT AN INKY LIQUID WHICH DISCOLORS THE WATER SO THATTHEY CANNOT BE SEEN BY THEIR ENEMIES. THIS IS USED IN MAKING SEPIA INK.FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN THE AFTERNOON I HAD MY LINE OVER AND AT SUNSETTIME IT HOOKED A POUND DOLPHIN FISH A CORYPHINEA. HE WAS FIFTYSIXINCHES LONG A LOVELY BLUISH GREEN COLOR YELLOW TAIL GREEN BACK ANDBLUE SIDES. DURING THE DAY WE HAD SEEN MANY OF THEM SWIMMING TWO ORTHREE FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE AROUND OUR BOW AND DARTING RIGHT NEARUNDER THE PULPIT. THE CREW HAD HAD ONE HOOKED BUT LOST IT AND DR. CADYALSO HAD ONE HOOKED.IN PULLING IT UP OVER THE BOOM THERE WAS GREAT FUN AND EXCITEMENT FORIT WAS HEAVY SLIPPERY AND THREE MEN HELPED BEFORE LANDING IT.THE GALPAGOS ISLANDSTHESE ISLANDS WERE FIRST CALLED THE ISLANDS OF TORTOISES AND THEY HAVEBEEN KNOWN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE. THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTY OF THEMAND THEY ARE LOCATED MOSTLY ON OR SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR SIX HUNDREDMILES OFF THE COAST OF ECUADOR TO WHICH COUNTRY THEY BELONG. THEY AREVOLCANIC ISLANDS WITH LAVA ROCK AND DRY SANDY DUST. VERY LITTLE ELSEEXCEPT CACTUS OR SCRUBBY BUSHES GROWS ON MOST OF THEM.OUR FIRST LANDING WAS AT SEYMOUR ISLAND APRIL FOURTH. THIS IS A SMALLFLAT ISLAND JUST OFF INDEFATIGABLE ONE OF THE BIGGER ISLANDS FEET HIGH. THERE IS LOTS OF CACTUS AND PRICKLY BUSHES ON THE STEEPERPART OF SEYMOUR BUT NEAR THE SHORE THE ROCKS ARE BARE AND BLACK ANDVERY HARD WHERE WE SAW OUR FIRST SEA LIONS LYING ABOUT SUNNINGTHEMSELVES JUST OUT OF TOUCH OF THE WAVES.IN SOME PLACES ON THE CLIFF THERE ARE BIG STREAKS OF REDDISH COLOR INTHE ROCKS LIKE IRON RUST. ALL ALONG THESE CLIFFS AND AT THE EDGE OFTHE WATER AND ON THE ROCKS WE SAW MANY BIRDSGALPAGOS GULLS PETRELSSHEARWATERS BOOBIES TWO SMALL GREEN HERONS A GREAT BLUE HERON ANDMANY LITTLE GULLS. PELICANS FLEW ABOUT AND EVEN TRIED TO LAND ON THEROWBOAT WHICH WENT ASHORE.OF COURSE AT FIRST I DIDNT KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL THE BIRDS BUT UNCLEWILL OR SOMEONE ELSE HELPED. WHEN THEY WERENT TOO BUSY THEY WOULD TELLME THE NAMES AND PRETTY SOON I GOT SO I KNEW MOST OF THEM. I THINK BYNOW I KNOW THE NAMES OF NEARLY ALL THE BIRDS IN THAT REGION.ANYWAY I LIKE BIRDS. AT HOME I AM TRYING TO LEARN TO KNOW THE NAMESAND I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION OF NESTS AND SOME EGGS. ONE NEST ISA CAMP ROBBERS NEST WHICH A RANGER IN YELLOWSTONE PARK GAVE TO ME.THEN I HAVE A WEAVER BIRDS NEST FROM INDIA AND A GOOD MANY OTHERS. DADIS LETTING ME HAVE A LITTLE ROOM ALL TO MYSELF FOR MY COLLECTION. ITWILL BE LIKE A LITTLE MUSEUM. THINGS WILL GO IN IT LIKE MY DRUM FROMNEW GUINEA WHICH FRANK HURLEY GAVE ME AND A HEAD HUNTERS SWORD FROMCOLOMBO.UNCLE WILL TOLD MOTHER LOOK OUT OR HE WILL BECOME A SCIENTISTPRETENDING HE THOUGHT THAT PRETTY BAD.WELL ID LIKE TO BE ONLY MOTHER SAYS FIRST I MUST LEARN A LOT ATSCHOOL IF I WANT TO TAKE TRIPS. DAD SAYS IF I DO WELL HE AND CARLDUNRUDTHAT IS A FOREST RANGER FRIEND OF OURS IN MONTANAWILL TAKE MEON A BIG PACKHORSE TRIP IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. I HAVE BEEN ON TWO TRIPSSOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE AND THEN IF I AM LUCKY PERHAPS ILL GO ON ATRIP ON A SCHOONER UP TO GREENLAND IN A COUPLE OF SUMMERS.THE DRY LAND IS FULL OF BIG LAND LIZARDS FOUR OR FIVE FEET LONG CALLEDCONOLOPHUS. THEY SCURRY ABOUT OVER THE DRY RIDGES AND THEN RUN UNDERTHE QUEER EVERGREENY BUSHES. THEY TRY TO BITE BUT IF YOU PICK THEM UPBY THEIR TAILS THEY CANNOT REACH YOUR HAND AND YOU CAN CARRY THEM ALLAROUND. THEY HAVE VERY BRIGHT COLORS YELLOWISH UNDERNEATH RED HEADSAND CLOSE TO LOOK LIKE PICTURES OF DRAGONS ONLY SMALLER. THE LITTLEBLACK WATER LIZARDS DO NOT BITE AND ARE ALMOST GENTLE WHEN YOU CATCHTHEM.THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF LIZARD HERE MUCH SMALLER WITH BRIGHT REDHEADS AND DULL GRAY BODIES.THESE ANIMALS AND BIRDS AND SEA LIONS HAVE SEEN SO FEW PEOPLE THAT THEYARE NOT AFRAID AT ALL AND WE WENT RIGHT UP VERY CLOSE TO MANY OF THEM.AS IT IS RIGHT ON THE EQUATOR THE SUNS GLARE IS VERY BRIGHT AND SO HOTTHAT FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS ALL OF US WERE VERY BADLY SUNBURNED ANDBLISTERED EVERYBODY WAS GOING AROUND WITH SORE SHOULDERS AND BLISTEREDLEGS AND TWO OR THREE EVEN HAD THEIR ENTIRE BACKS BURNED AND SORE.THE FIRST NIGHT HERE BILL MERRIAM AND DR. CADY WENT ASHORE AND CAUGHT ABIG FEMALE TURTLE THAT WAS GOING UP THE BEACH MAYBE TO LAY HER EGGS.SEA TURTLES COME ASHORE GO WAY UP A BEACH AND BURY THEIR EGGS IN THEDRY SAND. THEY LEAVE THEM THERE TILL IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO HATCH. WESAW MANY DEEP HOLES IN THE SAND FROM WHICH PILES OF EGGS HAD HATCHED.THEY LAY HUNDREDS OF EGGS. WHEN WE WERE THERE THE EGG SEASON WAS OVER.ALL WE SAW WERE SHELLS.TOWER ISLANDTOWER ISLAND WAS OUR SECOND LANDING. EARLY IN THE MORNING WE HADSIGHTED A LOW STRIP OF GREEN AND BY THE TIME BREAKFAST WAS OVER ATHALF PAST SEVEN WE WERE ALREADY IN THE MOST PROTECTED LITTLE COVE ORHARBOR. IT WAS ALMOST CLOSED TO THE OUTSIDE OCEAN AND WAS CALM WITHOUTANY SURF OR BIG WAVES. AT FIRST WHEN WE CAME IN WE COULDNT SEE ANYBEACH FOR LANDING ON OR SWIMMING BUT PRETTY SOON WE SAW ONE ABEAUTIFUL ONE HIDDEN BEHIND A SMALL REEF.WHEN WE ENTERED THE HARBOR BIRDS CAME AND RESTED ON THE MAST HEADS.MANY OF THEM STAYED THERE OR CAME BACK TO IT ON AND OFF ALL DAY. THEWHOLE RIGGING WAS FULL OF BOOBIES AND FRIGATE BIRDS.WE SAW THREE GREAT RAYS TOO AT LEAST FIFTEEN FEET ACROSS. LATER ON WECAUGHT A HUGE RAY. THEY SEEM TO FLY UNDER THE WATER JUST BELOW THESURFACE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY FLIP THEMSELVES RIGHT OUT OF THEWATER AND TURN A COMPLETE SOMERSAULT. SOMETIMES THEY DO THIS THREETIMES IN SUCCESSION. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES WE STRUCK WITH OUR BOW ANDNEATLY TURNED IT OVER.WHEN WE LANDED ON THE LITTLE BEACH WE SAW MANY OF THESE FRIGATE BIRDSON THEIR NESTS BOOBIES GULLS AND THE CUTEST LITTLE DOVES. THEYSEEMED SO TAME. THEY WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR EACH OTHERS TWIGS INTHEIR NESTS AND AS SOON AS A BIRD LEFT HER NEST ANOTHER BIRD CAME ANDSTOLE A TWIG AND FLEW AWAY WITH IT.I LIFTED A FRIGATE BIRD RIGHT OFF HIS NEST AND THEN PUT HIM BACK ANDHE NEVER SEEMED TO MIND AT ALL JUST LOOKED SURPRISED. ABOUT THE NEXTTIME I PICKED UP A FRIGATE BIRD I WASNT QUITE SO LUCKY. I WANTED TOLIFT HIM UP TO HAVE A PICTURE TAKEN AND HE DIDNT SEEM TO LIKE POSINGMUCH MORE THAN I DID. ANYWAY HE PECKED ME AND I SUPPOSE THATS WHY ILOOK SO CROSS IN THE PICTURE. THEY HAVE BIG STRONG BILLS AND THIS ONEGOT HOLD RIGHT IN THE LOWER PART OF MY LEFT LEG. ALL THE TIME I WASBARELEGGED AND WORE SHORTS WHICH IS THE WAY EVERYBODY ABOARD DRESSED.THE FRIGATE BIRDS AND BOOBIES WEIGH ABOUT TWO AND A HALF POUNDS. THEFORMER HAVE NOT WEBBED FEET LIKE THE BOOBIES AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOTCATCH FISH AS EASILY FOR THEY ONLY SWOOP DOWN AND DIP THEM OUT OF THEWATER BUT THE OTHER DIVES RIGHT IN AND SOMETIMES OUT OF SIGHT FORSEVERAL FEET UNDERNEATH AND SWIMS WITH HIS WEBBED FEET. FRIGATE BIRDSSTEAL THE OTHERS FISH. BOTH BIRDS HAVE TREMENDOUSLY LONG WINGS ANDSAIL IN THE SKY WITH A LONG LONG SPREAD.THE MALE FRIGATE HAS A QUEER POUCH ON HIS THROAT. HE IS DARK BROWNISHIN BODY WITH A FEW GREENY FEATHERS ON THE TOP OF HIS NECK AND THENTHIS VERY STRANGE BALLOON WHICH IS SO DISTENDED HE CAN REST HIS HEADUPON IT AND GO TO SLEEP. HE CAN PUFF IT UP OR HAVE IT EMPTY. THE MALESITS ON THE NEST IN THE MORNINGS MOSTLY WHILE HIS MATE GOES OUT TO SEAFISHING. SHE IS DARK BROWN WITH A WHITE BREAST. OF COURSE YOU CAN SEETHESE BRIGHT RED POUCHES A LONG WAY OFF AND THEY LOOK LIKE SO MANY TOYBALLOONS IN AMONG THE BUSHES. ALL THESE BIRDS THE BOOBIES ANDFRIGATES BUILD RATHER FOOLISH LOOKING NESTS RIGHT ON THE BUSHES ABOUTTWO FEET FROM THE GROUND SO OF COURSE ONE CAN GO RIGHT UP TO THEM ANDSEE THE EGGS OR YOUNG CHICKS.THE LITTLE DOVES AND THE MOCKING BIRDS HAVE THEIR NESTS ON THE GROUNDOFTEN UNDER A JUTTING OUT ROCK. THE DOVES HAVE BRIGHT RED FEET SOFTTAN BROWN BODIES AND EYES AS BLUE AS FORGETMENOT FLOWERS.ON TOWER WE SAW AMBLYRHINCHUS OR THE MARINE LIZARD. I REALLY LEARNEDTO PRONOUNCE THAT WORD ALTHOUGH I CANT SPELL IT YET. A LOT OF THESESCIENTIFIC NAMES ARE AWFULLY LONG AND HARD. IT IS BLACK ABOUT A FOOTLONG OR MAYBE FIFTEEN INCHES AND SWIMS IN AROUND THE EDGES OF THEROCKS. ALL THE SPECIMENS BROUGHT TO THE SHIP HAD SEAWEED IN THEIRSTOMACHS WHICH THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WAY OUT TO SEA TO GET.SOME OF THE CREW HAD SEEN GOATS AT SEYMOUR. THEY HAD BEEN LEFT THERE AHUNDRED YEARS AGO BY A SEA CAPTAIN WHO HAD HAD SOME ON HIS BOAT FORFRESH MILK HE TOOK THEM ASHORE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO EAT GRASS.EACH DAY HE TOOK FRESH WATER TO THEM. THEN ONE DAY THEY DID NOT COMEBACK FOR THE WATER AND HE GUESSED THEY HAD FOUND SOME ON THE ISLANDAND SAILED OFF LEAVING THEM THERE.BUT THERE ARE NO GOATS HERE NOR THE LAND LIZARDS WHICH WE HAD SEEN ATSEYMOUR. THE LAND IS ABSOLUTELY ALL LAVA ROCK AND CACTUS AND STIFFPRICKLY BUSHES WHICH MAKES CLIMBING AROUND VERY DIFFICULT. I MADE AFINE COLLECTION OF SHELLS THAT I FOUND ON THE BEACH.SEVERAL TIMES I WENT ASHORE IN THE EVENING WITH THE CREW AND ONE NIGHTTWO OF THE MEN HAD AN AWFUL FIGHT. JUST THE FEW OF US WERE ON THISDESERT BEACH ALONE AND IT REMINDED ME OF A STORY THAT DARWIN TOLD INHIS CRUISE OF THE BEAGLE NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. HE WENT TO ALITTLE LAKE ON ONE ISLAND AND SAW THERE THE SKULL OF A CAPTAIN WHO HADBEEN MURDERED BY HIS CREW THERE MANY YEARS BEFORE.DARWIN WAS A VERY FAMOUS SCIENTIST ABOUT  YEARS AGO. THIS BOOK THECRUISE OF THE BEAGLE DESCRIBES A GREAT VOYAGE HE TOOK IN THE SHIPBEAGLE AROUND SOUTH AMERICA AND MOSTLY AROUND THE WORLD. HE STOPPED ATTHE GALPAGOS ISLANDS. MOTHER READ THIS BOOK ALOUD TO ME. THERE WERETOO MANY THINGS TO SEE AND DO ON THE ARCTURUS FOR ME TO HAVE MUCH TIMETO READ. EVERYTHING WAS TOO INTERESTING AND THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHINGEXCITING HAPPENING. I THINK THE ONLY BOOK I READ THROUGH WAS IVANHOE.EARLY ONE MORNING DWIGHT WENT OFF WALKING ACROSS THE ISLAND. HE DID NOTCOME BACK AT FOUR WHEN THE SHIPS WHISTLE BLOWS TO CALL US ALL TO THELANDING BEACH NOR LATER AT BEDTIME AND NOT UNTIL MIDNIGHT. HE HADLOST HIS WAY FOR A TIME AND ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED A CRATER LAKE WHICHNO ONE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. ALTHOUGH IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLANDIT IS SALTY AND THE WATER MUST COME IN WITH THE TIDE. THERE AREMANGROVES AROUND ITS EDGE AND GREEN SCUM ON IT BUT SMALL FISH LIVE INIT.THE VOLCANOON APRIL NINETEENTH MOTHER WOKE ME UP AT ONE THIRTY IN THE MORNINGSAYING THERE WAS A FIRE WAY OFF TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF US AND THATTHE MATE AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT IT MUST BE A VOLCANO IN ERUPTION. FARAWAY IN THE SKY THERE WAS A FAINT PINK GLOW AND WE WERE ALL VERY MUCHEXCITED.THE NEXT MORNING WE LEFT TOWER ISLAND BECAUSE THE HARBOR WOULD BEDANGEROUS IN CASE OF A TIDAL WAVE OR ANY DISTURBANCE FROM ANEARTHQUAKE. TOWARDS EVENING AFTER TRAWLING AND FISHING ALL DAY AROUNDTOWER AND BINDLOE ISLANDS WE STARTED FOR THE DIRECTION OF NORTHALBEMARLE. WE COULD SEE THE GLOW FOR SEVENTY MILES OR MORE.LATER THAT NIGHT AS WE GOT NEARER THE RED GLOWED MUCH MORE AND THEGREAT BANK OF CLOUDS OVER IT WAS ALL PINK LIKE A VERY BRIGHT SUNSET. BYTHREE IN THE MORNING WE WERE WITHIN TEN MILES OF IT AND WE COULD SEEFLAMES AND JUTS OF SMOKE.IN THE MORNING UNCLE WILL AND JOHN TEE VAN WENT ASHORE. THEY HAD A HARDTIME FINDING A LANDING PLACE FOR THE SHORE WAS ALL STEEP LAVA CLIFFSAGAINST WHICH THE SURF BROKE. BUT FINALLY THEY WENT INTO A LITTLEPROTECTED COVE AND FROM THERE STARTED OFF FOR THE NEAREST SMOKINGPLACE THEY SAW. FOR A TIME WE COULD SEE THEM AS THEY CLIMBED OVER THETERRIBLY ROUGH LAVA FLOWS OLDER ONES THAT HAD BEEN COMING DOWN FORCENTURIES. BUT SOON WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM.THERE WAS A LOT OF PUMICE WHICH IS A VERY LIGHT STONE KIND OF PALEGRAY OR WHITISH IN COLOR. IT COMES FROM THE VOLCANOES LIKE THE LAVA.SOMETIMES WHEN YOU STEP INTO IT YOU SINK RIGHT UP TO YOUR KNEES. IT ISSO LIGHT IT FLOATS ON THE WATER. IT IS FINE FOR CLEANING STAINS OFFYOUR HANDS.AT ABOUT TWO THIRTY OR SO THEY CAME BACK TO THE SHORE AGAIN AND UNCLEWILL HAD SUCH TERRIBLE CRAMPS IN HIS LEGS HE COULD HARDLY STAND. THEYSAID THAT THEY ONLY WENT TO THE NEAREST PLACE FROM WHICH THE SMOKE WASCOMING. IT WAS SO HOT UNDERFOOT THEY HAD TO KEEP GOING IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO SIT DOWN OR REST BECAUSE OF THE HEAT. SO WHEN THEYFINALLY REACHED IT AFTER MUCH CLIMBING AND WALKING THERE WAS ONLY TIMETO TAKE SOME SAMPLES MAKE A FEW NOTES TEST THE GAS AND RETURN.UNCLE WILL NAMED THE TWO VOLCANOES MT. WILLIAMS AND MT. WHITON AFTERMR. HARRISON WILLIAMS AND MR. HENRY D. WHITON TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HELPEDMOST IN MAKING THE ARCTURUS TRIP POSSIBLE.THE VOLCANO WAS ERUPTING ON THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAIN NOT ON THE TOPAND THERE WERE MANY OTHER LITTLE PLACES FROM WHICH SMOKE AND CINDERSWERE COMING THROUGH BESIDES JUST THE ONE BIG CRATER. AT NIGHT WHEN THEFIRE SHOWED MORE IN THE DARK IT LOOKED LIKE TRAINS OF BRIGHTLY LIGHTEDCARS RUNNING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE.NEXT DAY I WENT ASHORE WITH BETTY AND LIN. I SAW THREE SEA LIONS TWOHUGE CRAWFISH OR SPECKLED LOBSTERS MANY SHARKS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENTKINDS OF SMALL FISH. I STAYED RIGHT IN THE LITTLE BAY BECAUSE IT WAS SOHARD WALKING AROUND ON THE LAVA WHICH WAS JUST LIKE CLINKERS.THIS DAY THE GROUPERS BIG HEAVY ROCK FISH WERE SO HUNGRY THEY EVENATTACKED THE MOVING PROPELLER OF BILLS EVINRUDE ENGINE AND WHEN HESHOOK HIS SOCK AT THEM THEY ACTUALLY GRABBED IT. I WOULD NOT WANT TOJUMP OVER NEAR THAT SHORE. I BELIEVE THE BIG GROUPERS WOULD ATTACK AMAN. WE SAW MORE BIG DEVIL FISH JUMPING NEAR HERE THAN AT ANY OTHERPLACE. AND THE CREW HOOKED SEVERAL SHARKS.A DAY ASHOREWHEN I GO ASHORE I USUALLY TAKE A NET FOR FISH OR BUTTERFLIES ANDBOTTLES IN WHICH TO PUT INSECTS A CANTEEN OF FRESH WATER A HELMET TOKEEP THE HEAT OF THE SUN FROM MY HEAD AND IN THE TROPICS THIS IS VERYIMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO PROTECT THE BACK OF THE NECK FROM THE SUN.ALSO I LIKE TO HAVE A GIG OR SPEAR WITH WHICH I CAN GET SOME OF THEKINDS OF FISH WHICH DO NOT BITE AT BAIT.MY MAIN IDEA IS TO GET BIRDS EGGS. GULLS NESTS ARE MOSTLY ON THEROCKS OF THE CLIFFS DOVES BUILD ON THE LAVA ROCK ON THE GROUND OR INLITTLE CREVASSES MOCKING BIRDS IN LOW BUSHES OR THE CACTUS TREES ORSHRUBS AND THE BIG BOOBIES AND FRIGATE BIRDS MAKE UGLY TWIG NESTSABOUT TWO OR THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEMNEARER THE SHORE ALTHOUGH I DID SEE SOME ON MY WAY UP TO THE CRATERLAKE THAT DWIGHT HAD DISCOVERED IN THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND AND THESEWERE IN HIGHER TREES. THERE WAS ONE BIG NEST RIGHT ON THE LAVA ROCKUNDER A TREE. IT WAS A GREEN HERONS NEST AND THE THREE HALF GROWNBIRDS WALKED OUT OF THE NEST WHEN I CAME NEAR.ONE DAY I SPEARED TWO CRAWFISH IN A POOL RIGHT NEAR SHORE BUT THEPRONGS OF THE GIG WERE TOO SHORT TO HOLD THEM AND THEY GOT FREE ANDDARTED AWAY. I LOST A MORAY OR POISONOUS EEL THE SAME WAY.WHEN WE SWIM AT THE BEACHES OR IN THE OCEAN POOLS NEAR THE SHORE WEHAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR SHARKS STING RAYS AND MORAYS.ONE DAY AT TOWER ISLAND I WENT TO CLIMB THE CLIFF FOR BIRDS EGGS. ITOOK TWO BOXES OF SOFT COTTON FOR PACKING ANY EGGS I MIGHT FIND. AND ASI WENT ALONG I TAPPED THE GROUND TO MAKE THE SMALL BIRDS FLY UP FROMTHEIR NESTS. THIS WAY I COULD LOCATE THEM.I FOUND A MOCKING BIRDS NEST TOOK ONE EGG GOT SOME FRIGATE EGGS ANDA GULLS EGG. THEN I TURNED TO COME BACK AND I COULD NOT REMEMBER THEWAY. SO I MADE FOR THE CLIFF AND THE SEA AND CAME ALONG TILL I FOUND APLACE TO CLIMB DOWN AGAIN OVER THE HUGE BOULDERS OF LOOSE LAVA ROCK.THE FRIGATE NESTS WERE NEAR THE SHORE. THEIR EGGS ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OFA HENS EGG QUITE WHITE. THE GALPAGOS GULLS EGGS ARE SMALLER. ANDTHE BOOBIES EGGS ARE LIKE THE FRIGATES ONLY A LITTLE SMALLER.AFTER HUNTING FOR BIRDS EGGS I THOUGHT I WOULD GO OVER TO SEE WHAT LINWAS DOING IN THE BIG SHALLOW POOLS ACROSS THE BEACH. SHE WAS FISHINGWITH A TINY HOOK AND LINE. SO I TRIED TOO AND I CAUGHT A LOVELYLITTLE BLUE AND SILVERY FISH ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG. IT HAD SMALL WHITESPECKLES AND WAS A NEW SPECIES. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISHIN THESE LITTLE POOLS WHOLE SCHOOLS OF THEM VARYING FROM ONE TOEIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND SOME WITH VERY LOVELY COLORS MANY HAVINGSTRIPES OF GOLD AND SILVER.LATER I SPEARED A WHOLE COLLECTING BAG FULL OF CRABS FOR MOTHER TO USEAS BAIT FOR HER FISHING OUT IN THE INLET. THE BLACK LAVA ROCKS ARE JUSTFULL OF BRIGHT COLORED CRABS CRAWLING AROUND ... THOUSANDS OF SMALLBLACK ONES SPECKLED AND LIGHTER COLOR SANDY ONES AND GREAT BIGBRIGHT RED ONES. EVIDENTLY THEY ARE ALL CHASING EACH OTHER ALL THETIME AND ACTING LIKE CANNIBALS. AND THEN THE REST OF THE TIME THEBIRDS ARE SWOOPING DOWN AND SNATCHING ONE. THEY CERTAINLY SCURRY THEMINUTE A SHADOW APPEARS AND DART UP AND DOWN THE ROCKS SO QUICKLY ITIS HARD TO CATCH THEM.THE SHIPS WHISTLE BLOWS AT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING AND AT FOUR AT NIGHTTO WARN US TO RETURN TO THE BEACH TO BE FERRIED OUT AGAIN.THE DIVING HELMETIN ADDITION TO THE NETS AND TRAWLS AND DREDGES THE SHIP IS EQUIPPEDWITH A DIVING APPARATUS. IT IS A HELMET OR HEAD PIECE BUT NOT THE RESTOF A SUIT.THIS TALL HELMET IS MADE OF THICK BRASS WITH A TRIANGLE SHAPED GLASSWINDOW IN THE FRONT. IT FITS ON THE SHOULDERS AND THERE IS AN AIR SPACEINSIDE SO ONE CAN BREATHE. THEN FRESH AIR IS PUMPED IN BY A HAND PUMPAND WHOLE FLOCKS OF BUBBLES KEEP RISING TO THE SURFACE COMING OUT FROMUNDER YOUR ARM PITS.UNCLE WILL IS THE BEST ONE AT IT FOR HE HAS USED IT MOST AND GOES DOWNOFTENEST. IT CAN BE USED AT ANY DEPTH A MAN CAN STAND PRESSURE AND OFCOURSE THE DEEPER DOWN THE STRONGER THE PRESSURE AND ONE FEELS THISESPECIALLY IN THE EARS. THEY BUZZ AND HURT AS THOUGH SOMEONE WASPUSHING ON THEM. YOU HAVE TO SWALLOW HARD TO KEEP BACK THIS FEELING ANDEQUALIZE THE PRESSURE THE SAME AS GOING DOWN IN A HIGH ELEVATOR.THERE IS AIR IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES SO YOU CAN SEE JUST AS PERFECTLY ASWHEN YOU ARE ON THE SURFACE. WHOLE CROWDS OF TINY FISHES SWIM BY MANYOF THEM DIFFERENT COLORS AND VERY BRIGHT. PINK OR GREEN OR BLUE ORSILVERY OR STRIPED ONES.ONE DAY AS UNCLE WILL ENTERED THE WATER AND WAS JUST GOING DOWN AHUGE SHARK SWAM BY. HE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WENT DOWN AND THESHARK HAD APPARENTLY GONE ALONG ON HIS BUSINESS. LATER HE HAD A CAGEBUILT SO HE COULD STAY IN THAT AND LOOK AROUND IF THERE WERE TOO MANYSHARKS.THAT AFTERNOON WHEN HE WENT DOWN HE SAW MANY VERY STRANGE FISH SOMEBRIGHT ORANGE AND BLACK WITH A WHITE CROSS LIKE A BELT OTHERS DARKGRAY WITH YELLOW TAILS.OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE IN THESE WATERS TO SEE OCTOPUS BIGSTING RAYS OR DEVIL FISH AND SHARKS. SO THE CAGE WITH THREE HEAVY WIRESIDES ONE CAN STAND IN IS PRETTY NICE.ONE DAY I WENT DOWN. I WAS A LITTLE SCARED BECAUSE THE HELMET WEIGHSFORTY POUNDS OR MORE AND THE STUFFY FEELING OF HAVING SOMETHING OVERONES HEAD IS UNPLEASANT. I WENT OVER THE STERN OF A ROWBOAT IN ABOUTFIFTEEN FEET OF WATER NEAR SHORE AND CLIMBED DOWN A HEAVY IRON LADDERHOLDING ONTO THE ROUNDS. THERE IS A KIND OF ROAR FROM THE AIR COMINGIN AND A CURIOUS FEELING AGAINST THE EARS BUT OTHERWISE IT IS GRANDFUN TO BE DOWN UNDERNEATH THE SEA AND SEE ALL THE ROCKS AND LEDGES ANDFISH SWIMMING PAST.YOUR FEET SEEM TO FLOAT OUT AROUND YOU AND THE DISTANCES UNDER THEWATER ALL LOOK DIFFERENT. YOU THINK YOU CAN REACH OUT AND TAKE HOLD OFSOMETHING NOT BELIEVING IT IS FAR AWAY.IT MUST BE FUN TO GO DOWN OFTEN ENOUGH TO GET USED TO THE FEELING ANDTHEN WALK ALL AROUND ON THE BOTTOM LIKE THE PEARL DIVERS DO OR THE MENWHO GO WAY DOWN BELOW TO SALVAGE WRECKS.THE SHIPWRECKED MANTODAY CHRISTIANSON IS A TAXI DRIVER IN NEW YORK CITY BUT IN NOVEMBER HE WAS A SAILOR ON THE SHIP ALEXANDER BOUND FROM SOUTH WALES TOPANAMA WITH A CARGO OF COAL. FRED JEFF WAS HIS PAL AND THEY HAD MADEOTHER VOYAGES TOGETHER.THE STORY OF THE WRECKED TAXI CAB DRIVER IS TOLD IN A CHAPTER IN UNCLEWILLS BOOK GALPAGOS WORLDS END. I READ IT LONG BEFORE I EVERTHOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF MY REALLY SEEING THE ISLANDS MYSELF.IT IS ABOUT THE MOST INTERESTING ADVENTURE STORY YOU COULD IMAGINE.ON MAY TH THE CAPTAIN SAID THEY WERE SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OFF SOUTHAMERICA AND THE WEATHER WAS STILL BAD BECAUSE THEY HAD NO WIND ANDTHE ALEXANDER WAS A SAILING SHIP. FOR THREE WEEKS THEY HAD JUSTDRIFTED. HE THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER PUT TO SEA IN THE SMALL BOATSBECAUSE WATER WAS SCARCE AND THEIR SUPPLIES HAD GIVEN OUT. GALPAGOSISLANDS WERE THE NEAREST LAND SO THEY STARTED FOR THEM.THEY HAD SIXTEENFOOT OARS AND ROWED FOR TWELVE DAYS FOUR MEN ON ANDFOUR OFF TAKING TURNS. ONE DAY THE OLD COOK CRIED OUT LAND. NOBODYBELIEVED HIM AT FIRST BUT SOON THEY COULD MAKE OUT A DIM CLOUDLIKEOBJECT ON THE FAR HORIZON. THEY REALIZED IT WAS REALLY LAND AND PULLEDHARD ON THE OARS TILL THEY CAME TO A SMALL BEACH TO LAND ON. THEYFAIRLY RAN UP THE BEACH TO TRY TO FIND WATER FOR THEY WERE ALLSUFFERING FROM THIRST. AFTER A SHORT TIME THEY WERE ATTRACTED BY THEOLD COOK CRYING OUT AND WAVING HIS HANDS.BUT THEY RAN ABOUT LICKING UP THE BRACKISH WATER FROM PUDDLES IN THEROCKS. THE RAIN HAD LEFT SOME BUT THE SURF HAD THROWN SPRAY UP INTOTHE POOLS. HOWEVER THEY DRANK UP THE SURFACE FOR THE SALT WAS AT THEBOTTOM.WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK FOR THE COOK THEY SAW HIM ALONE ON THE BEACH. ITWAS TOO LATE TO HELP HIM THEIR BOAT HAD SMASHED TO PIECES ON THEROCKS. THEY WERE ON A SMALL ISLAND TEN MILES FROM ANOTHER BIG ONE.THE CAPTAIN SAID NOW WE ARE ALL JUST MEN TOGETHER NOT CAPTAIN ANDCREW. AND WE WILL TRY TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND. THEYSTARTED OUT TO CROSS OVER BUT THE WAY WAS TERRIBLY ROUGH THEY WEREEXHAUSTED AND WEAKENED BY LONG SUFFERING AND AFTER A SHORT DISTANCETHEY HAD TO COME BACK.THEY WALKED AROUND THE ISLAND LATER AND IN ONE COVE THEY DISCOVEREDSOME SEA LIONS AND TWO OF THE MEN WHO WERE GOOD SWIMMERS WENT OUT ANDCHASED THEM TO SHORE. ONCE ASHORE THE REST OF THE MEN STONED THEM TODEATH SKINNED THEM FOR SHOE LEATHER ATE THE MEAT AND DRANK THEBLOOD. ALL WERE SICK AS A RESULT BUT LATER THEY FOUND TURTLES ANDAFTER KILLING THEM SUCKED THE BLOOD AND ATE THE MEAT.AFTER TWO MONTHS OF LIVING LIKE THIS WITH VERY HARD GOING THEY FOUNDA SMALL BEACH WITH FRESH WATER. HERE THEY BURIED A LOT OF GOLD IN ACRACK IN THE ROCKS. AND ONE DAY AFTER LIVING ON THAT ONE BEACH FORTHREE OR MORE MONTHS THEY WERE RESCUED BY A CHANCE SHIP SAILING BY.WHEN CHRISTIANSON HEARD THAT UNCLE WILL WAS COMING ON THIS TRIP AGAINHE WANTED TO COME BACK HERE MOSTLY TO FIND THE GOLD. BUT HE COULD NOTAFFORD TO LEAVE HIS JOB AND HE WOULD NOT TELL JUST WHERE IT WASBURIED.HOOD ISLANDAFTER CRUISING AROUND TO THE SOUTH OF THE GALPAGOS ISLANDS FOR TWODAYS DOING DEEP DREDGING AND HAULING WE TURNED BACK TO HOOD THE MOSTSOUTHERLY OF ALL THE ISLANDS. IT IS LOWLYING WITH TWO OR THREE RATHERHIGHER HILLS AND AT THE SOUTH END AN ALBATROSS ROOKERY WHICH SHOWS WAYOUT AT SEA A HIGH ROCKY HEADLAND WITH THE BIRDS SHOWING WHITE AGAINSTTHE BLACK ROCKS.COMPARED TO THE OTHER ISLANDS THERE IS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT HOOD. THEREARE LOTS OF SEA LIONS ON THE BEACHES AND IN THE COVES AROUND THE ROCKS.YOU MAY GET ALMOST CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH THEM. ISABEL COOPER WHO ISNOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING CREPT NEAR ENOUGH TO PAT ONE OLD BULL ON THEFLIPPER. WHEN SHE LAUGHED ALOUD HE GAVE A CURIOUS GRUNT AND SLID INTOTHE WATER.WE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL OF THE SEA LIONS HAD EYE DISEASE MANY OF THELITTLE PUPS BEING ENTIRELY BLIND AND THE OLDER ONES HAVING PERHAPS ONEEYE DIMMED WITH A WHITE FILM. SO BILL MERRIAM SHOT ONE OF THEM BROUGHTIT TO THE BOAT AND THE DOCTOR TOOK THE EYES OUT TO STUDY THE SICKNESS.I WENT ASHORE WITH THE CREW ONE DAY AND WE GOT A HUGE LOG WHICH WASCOVERED WITH BARNACLES. WE PUSHED IT BACK INTO THE WATER AGAIN ANDPLAYED WITH IT DIVING AND CLIMBING OVER IT AND FOOLING WITH IT AS WEWOULD A RAFT AT HOME. THE WATER IS BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR THE WHITE SANDAND THE BLACK ROCKS SHOWING UP PERFECTLY CLEARLY FOR MANY FEET DEEP. OFCOURSE WE WERE ALL TERRIBLY SCRATCHED WITH ROUGH HOUSING BUT IT WASGOOD FUN AND FINE EXERCISE.I LIFTED UP SOME OF THE BLACK ROCKS ALONG THE BEACH AT LOW TIDE ANDFOUND A SMALL OCTOPUS. SOMEONE TOOK HIM OUT OF THE JAR I HAD PUT HIMINTO TO LOOK AT HIM AND LEFT HIM IN THE SUN SO HE DIED. BUT HE WASVALUABLE AS A SPECIMEN ON THE SHIP AND HAS BEEN PUT WITH THE OTHER JARSABOARD.THE BEACHES HERE AT HOOD HAVE VERY SOFT WHITE SAND UNLIKE THAT ATTOWER WHICH IS CRUMBLED UP CORAL AND SHARP AND CUTS THE FEET.ALSO THERE ARE MANY BAYS OR COVES LIKE FIORDS ALONG THE SHORE. DONDICKERMAN ONE OF THE BEST COLLECTORS IN THE OUTFIT WAS GETTINGBEAUTIFUL STARFISH SOME LIKE WORMS SOME BRITTLE AND A LOVELY PINKISHCORAL COLOR AND SOME SMALL RED AND GREEN FISH WHILE I ROWED THE BOATAROUND SO IT WOULDNT SMASH ON THE ROCKS. WHEN HE WAS DOING THIS I SAWSEVEN SHARKS ONE HUGE TURTLE AND ONE SMALL ONE.ANOTHER DAY JOHN TEE VAN TOOK ME WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT ASHORE TO TRAPBIRDS. HE USES A LONG POLE WITH A SMALL TWIG ON THE END. THIS ISCOVERED WITH VERY STICKY PASTE. HE WHISTLES THE SONG OF THE BIRD ANDWHEN IT COMES TO SEE WHO IT IS JOHN HITS HIM ON THE BACK A LIGHT TAPWHICH MAKES HIM STICK TO THE TWIG. THEN JOHN TAKES HIM OFF WIPES OFFTHE PASTE PUTS HIM IN A BOX AND TAKES HIM TO THE SHIP.DWIGHT FRANKLIN HARPOONED A BIG RAY ALONG THE SHORE OF THE BEACH ANDLOST THE HARPOON. AFTERWARDS WE SAW THE HANDLE GOING ALONG THE SURFACE.HE GOT FOUR OTHER RAYS BUT NEVER CAUGHT THE ONE THAT HAD GONE OFF WITHTHE HARPOON HANDLE. WE SAW SPOTTED RAYS BROWN ONES RED ONES AND BLACKONES.AT NIGHT WHEN WE ARE AT ANCHOR THERE ARE TWO GREAT ARC LIGHTS LOWEREDOVER THE SHIPS SIDE ONE OVER THE BOOM AND ONE ABOVE THE GANGWAY. THISBRIGHT LIGHT ATTRACTS THE FISH IN GREAT NUMBERS. AT HOOD THE FLYINGFISH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL AND A LARGE SIZETEN OR TWELVE INCHES LONGWITH LOVELY PINKISH PURPLE WINGS OR FINS. ONE NIGHT I HARPOONED ENOUGHFOR BREAKFAST FOR THE CROWD.THE FISH SEEM TO GET QUITE CRAZY WITH THE LIGHT AND THEY DART AROUNDCRACKING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE BOATS AND THE SHIPSIDE. TO ADD TO THEEXCITEMENT SEA LIONS COME SKIMMING BY AND SNATCH AT THE WOUNDED ONESGULPING THEM DOWN AND STUFFING THEMSELVES ON MORE. ONE BIG SEA LIONCAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE GANGWAY FOR ME TO REACH OVER AND TOUCH HIM.ANOTHER NIGHT I CAUGHT A PORTUGUESE MANOWAR IN A SCOOP NET AND WASSTUNG BY HIM ON BOTH HANDS. THIS IS A JELLY FISH KIND OF THING WITHLONG TRAILERS OR TENTACLES. AND THESE TENTACLES ARE POISONOUS AND STINGTHEIR PREY SO THEY CAN EAT THE LITTLE FISH OR PLANKTON. I ALSO CAUGHT ALITTLE TRANSPARENT FISH PALE COLORS WITH DABS OF BRIGHT RED ON THELOWER FIN. MISS COOPER PAINTED HIM. AND I GOT A BRIGHT RED SQUID ANDMANY SMALL CRABS ONE OF WHICH WAS SCARLET.ALTOGETHER I THINK I HAD THE MOST FUN AT HOOD ISLAND BECAUSE THE BEACHWAS SO LONG AND THE SHORE LINE WAS SO EASY TO EXPLORE. MOTHER WENT TOTHE TOPS OF THREE OF THE HIGHEST PEAKS IN THE ISLAND AND SAW WAY OVERTHE FIRST RIDGE A LONG LOW LAGOON OF FRESH WATER PROBABLY RAIN WATERWITH GREAT REDDISH MUDDY POOLS.THERE ARE MANY GOATS HERE QUITE WILD AND UNUSED TO MAN. SOME AREBRIGHT FAUN COLOR OTHERS HAVE BLACK STRIPES OR SPOTS AND ONE OLD BUCKWHICH THE CREW SHOT AND BROUGHT IN HAD ENTIRE WHITE HIND QUARTERSBROWNISH HEAD BLACK BEARD AND LARGE HORNS. THEY EAT THE CACTUS LEAVESAND THE SMALL TREES AND THE WISPS OF GRASS.THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF SOIL HERE REDDISH AND EVIDENTLY VERY HEAVYRAINS AT THIS SEASON. THE LAGOONS ARE FRESH RAIN WATER AND IN PLACESCLIMBING UP THE MOUNTAINS IT SEEMS LIKE HALF DRIED STREAM BEDS OR WATERCOURSESROCKS AND MUDDY PLACES BETWEEN AND THEN GREAT TERRACES OFTUFFA ROCK A VERY SHARP LAVA ROCK WHICH IS HARD TO CLIMB OVER.A DAY ON SHIPBOARDSOON AFTER DAWN EACH DAY ONE OF THE CREW WASHES THE DECKS. AND IT SEEMSONLY A SHORT TIME LATER THAT WILLIE THE GERMAN MESS BOY CALLS HALLFPASS SEEX. I JUMP OUT OF MY COT ON THE UPPER DECK PUT ON SHORTSSHIRT AND SNEAKERS AND BEAT IT FOR BREAKFAST AT SEVEN OCLOCK.JUST AFTER BREAKFAST OR JUST BEFORE THE TEMPERATURES ARE TAKEN ANDSAMPLES OF WATER BROUGHT UP FROM THE DIFFERENT DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN.WHEN THAT IS FINISHED THE DEPTH OF THE OCEAN IS MEASURED. THIS ISCALLED SOUNDING. A HEAVY LEAD WEIGHING SEVENTYFIVE POUNDS IS LETOVER ON A PIANO WIRE TILL BOTTOM IS REACHED. OF COURSE THE SHIPSENGINES HAVE TO BE STOPPED WHILE THIS IS GOING ON. THE SOUNDING MACHINEHAS A CONTRAPTION FOR BRINGING UP SAMPLES OF THE SEA BOTTOM SO THATONE KNOWS IF THERE IS SAND OR MUD OR ROCK BELOW. OUR SOUNDINGS HAVEVARIED FROM  FATHOMS TO  FATHOMS. A FATHOM IS SIX FEET.IT IS FUN TO FEEL THE ICY COLD WATER BROUGHT UP SOMETIMES JUST ABOVEFREEZING ALTHOUGH WE AT THE SURFACE ARE BROILING WITH HEAT IF WE GETOUT OF THE BREEZE.THE NETS ARE PUT DOWN  FATHOMS OR MORE. THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR NETSLET OUT ON THE SAME CABLE  TO  FATHOMS APART. THE NET GOES OUTFOR TWO HOURS THEN BEGINS HAULING IN. AND OF COURSE THERE ISEXCITEMENT WHEN IT COMES UP FOR EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE FIRST IF THENETS ARE STILL ON AND THEN WHAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THEM. IN IT ARETINY FISH PIECES OF STRANGE UNKNOWN FISH ONCE A BLACK OCTOPUS WITH AQUEER UMBRELLALIKE ARRANGEMENT OVER HIS MOUTH AND HEAD. EARLY IN THEVOYAGE SEVERAL NETS WERE LOST BECAUSE THEY TWISTED OFF FROM THE CABLE.AND ONE WAS CUT OFF BY THE PROPELLERS.NEXT WE FEED THE ANIMALS. THE MOCKING BIRDS HAVE CRUMBS THE LIZARDSARE FORCIBLY FED WITH BITS OF BREAD AND WATER THE TWO VERY LOVELYALBATROSSES EAT FISH WHICH IS KEPT ON THE ICE FOR THEM. THESE ARE NOWAT THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK IN THE BRONX. I HOPE THEY LIKE ITTHERE. AND THE LITTLE FISH IN THE AQUARIUM ARE GIVEN THE CRUMBS FROMTHE NIGHTLY PLANKTON NETS. THE NICE LITTLE PENGUIN DIED ALTHOUGH FORDAYS HE CAME OUT AND HAD A SWIM THEN GOBBLED UP FISH.THEN WE HAVE LUNCH. ONE DAY THE SHIP WAS STOPPED FOR HALF AN HOUR THEGANGWAY LET DOWN AND WE WENT SWIMMING RIGHT IN THE OCEAN. IT WAS OVER AMILE AND A HALF DEEP TOO. AND BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR WATER. IF YOU EVEN LETYOURSELF SINK A FEW FEET BELOW THE SURFACE YOU COULD SEE RIGHT UNDEROUR SHIP WITH THE SUNLIGHT SHOWING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE.FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN THE AFTERNOON WE SEEMED TO BE IN A LOT OFDRIFTING STUFF. WE SAW TWO TURTLES SOME BIG LOGS WITH BIRDS RESTING ONTHEM AND HUNDREDS OF TINY FISH SWIMMING ROUND IN THE SHADOW UNDERNEATHAND TWO POISONOUS SEA SNAKES ALL BROWN AND BRIGHT YELLOW. WE CAUGHT ASMALL DOLPHIN FISH ON A LINE AND WHILE PULLING IT IN THREE SHARKSFOLLOWED.ALL THE NETS WERE IN BEFORE FIVE OCLOCK FOR WE HAVE SUPPER AT THATTIME. IT IS NICE TO SIT UP ON THE ROOF OF THE LABORATORY TO WATCH THESUNSET AND THE MOONLIGHT LATER. AND AT EIGHT OCLOCK THE PLANKTON NETGOES OUT FOR A SHORT WHILE. PLANKTON IS VERY SMALL SEA LIFE LIKE BUGSQUEER FISH THAT CANT MOVE THEMSELVES. AND THEN TO BED FOR ANOTHER DAYJUST LIKE IT TOMORROW.DREDGINGTHE BLAKE DREDGE HAS A TENFOOT IRON BAR ACROSS THE TOP A HANDLEARRANGEMENT AND A LONG TWENTYFOOT NET AT THE BOTTOM IN WHICH THINGSARE THROWN AFTER BEING LOOSENED BY THE TOP BAR. THE BOTTOM OF THE NETIS FASTENED SO THAT SPECIMENS CANNOT BE DROPPED OUT.THIS IS PUT WAY DOWN TILL IT IS ON THE OCEAN BOTTOM AND THEN TRAWLEDALONG SLOWLY FOR AN HOUR OR MORE. SOMETIMES THE WHOLE DREDGE IS LOSTWHEN IT HITS AN UNEXPECTED MOUNTAIN PEAK OR ROCK OR LEDGE AT THEBOTTOM AS IT WAS AT ABINGDON ISLAND AND ONCE THE WHOLE THING WASTERRIBLY TWISTED AND BENT OUT OF SHAPE BECAUSE OF HITTING SOMETHING WAYDOWN IN THE DEPTHS.IT IS DRAGGED ALONG THE TOP IRON BAR LOOSENING THINGS FROM THE FLOOROF THE SEA DUMPING THEM INTO THE NET AND THEN BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE.THE THINGS BROUGHT UP ARE ALWAYS VERY COLD OFTEN JUST ABOVE FREEZINGBECAUSE IT IS SO COLD DOWN THERE. ONE DAY A WHOLE BUCKET LOAD OF SEACUCUMBERS CAME UP IN THE NET AND THEY WERE ICY COLD AS IF THEY HAD BEENIN AN ICEBOX.SOMETIMES THERE ARE FISH PIECES OF CORAL BITS OF ROCK LEGS OR EVEN AWHOLE STARFISH MANY SEA CUCUMBERS AND ONCE OR TWICE A STRANGE FISHWITH CURIOUS CONTRAPTIONS FOR LIGHTING HIS WAY AROUND A LONG TENTACLEOR BARBEL OUT IN FRONT OF HIM WITH A LIGHT ON IT OR A BULB ON TOP OFHIS HEAD ON A CURIOUS TRAILER THING OUT IN FRONT OF HIS MOUTH SO OTHERFISH WILL BE DECOYED IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE THEN SWALLOWS THEM.WHEN THE DREDGE IS COMING IN WE STAND AROUND TO SEE WHAT IT BRINGS UP.FOR TWO HOURS THE CABLE WILL BE COMING IN AND WINDING UP ON THE HUGEDRUM BY MACHINERY THEN AT LAST THE NET SHOWS UNDER THE WATER. EVERYONEHURRIES TO THE SIDE AND HOLDS DISHES OR BUCKETS OR TUBS OF WATER INTOWHICH TO DUMP SPECIMENS.AND THE CREW HELP ONE AT THE ENGINE ONE OILING WIRE AS IT WINDS ONTHE DRUM AND TWO OR THREE OF US BEATING THE CABLE WITH HEAVY CLUBS TOSHAKE OFF THE WATER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT FROM RUSTING.MANY OF THE DEEP SEA THINGS ARE VERY BRIGHT RED. THE SHRIMPS THESTARFISH AND THE CUCUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT COLORS REDDISH YELLOWISHWHITE PURPLE AND EVEN A BRIGHT BLUISH ONE CAME UP.PANAMAPANAMA IS CROWDED WITH BLACKS INDIANS HINDUS SPANISH AND MANYCHINESE. THE STREETS ARE NARROW AND FULL OF PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. THESTORES OPEN RIGHT UPON THE STREETS AND ALL THE HOUSES ARE BUILT AT THEEDGE OF THE SIDEWALK WITH BALCONIES ON THE UPPER STORIES OUT OVER THESIDEWALK.SOME OF THE CHILDREN ARE TERRIBLE BEGGARS AND HANG ONTO YOUR COAT WHILEYOU ARE WALKING ALONG THE STREET. AND MANY OF THEM RUN AROUND WITHOUTA THING ON STARK NAKED FUNNY LITTLE BLACK CHILDREN.WE DROVE OUT TO OLD PANAMA ONE DAY AND SAW THE RUINS OF WHAT USED TOBE THE RICHEST CITY IN THE NEW WORLD. ALL THE PIRATES KNEW THIS WAS AVERY RICH CITY AND FULL OF TREASURES. GOLD WAS BROUGHT THERE FROM PERUAND THEN SHIPPED TO SPAIN ON SPANISH SHIPS.IN  HENRY MORGAN A FAMOUS ENGLISH PIRATE AND ADVENTURER CAMEACROSS THE ISTHMUS AND ATTACKED THE CITY OF OLD PANAMA. THE CITY BURNEDUP ALMOST ALL OF IT AND THE FEW PEOPLE WHO ESCAPED THEN MADE ANOTHERCITY WHICH IS THE PRESENT PANAMA SIX MILES AWAY. IT IS A BETTER PLACEWITH A BETTER HARBOR AT THE MOUTH OF THE BOCA GRANDE RIVER.WE WENT TO THE TOP OF ANCON HILL IN AN AUTO WAY UP ABOVE THE CITY TOGET THE VIEWWAY OFF OVER THE CANAL OVER THE CITY FAR BEYOND THE OLDPANAMA RUINS AND OF COURSE FAR OUT TO SEA. THERE ARE THREE CANNONS ONTHIS HILL AND I COULD TURN ONE ALL BY MYSELF AND SEE HOW IT WORKS. IFPANAMA SHOULD EVER BE ATTACKED THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL HILL FORPROTECTING THE CITY. THERE ARE FORTIFICATIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF THECANAL ENTRANCE AT BALBOA. THEY ALSO HAVE QUITE A FEW AEROPLANES.WE WENT SWIMMING AT THE BALBOA CLUBHOUSE POOL ONE OF THE BEST I HAVEEVER SEEN. MR. GRIESER SHOWED ME THE PROPER LEG STROKE FOR THE CRAWLAND I MET A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY THERE WHO HAD GONE TO NEW YORK WITH ACRACK TEAM OF SWIMMERS. HE DIVED FROM A SIXTYFOOT BOARD IN MADISONSQUARE GARDEN.DON DICKERMAN BOUGHT THREE DUGOUTS FROM A NATIVE FISHERMAN IN PANAMAAND HE ALSO GOT TWO MONKEYS A CEBUS A MARMOSET AND A CUNNING LITTLEMONKEYLIKE ANIMAL CALLED A KINKAIU WHICH GOES OUT MOSTLY AT NIGHT.THIS LAST LITTLE ONE WAS VERY SOFT AND FURRY AND WAS VERY GENTLE TOO.HE CURLED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO KEEP IN THE DARK ALL DAY SLEEPING. IHOPE I CAN BUY ONE SOME TIME FOR I LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE OTHER PETS.BOBBIE FISH BOUGHT A LITTLE PET CALLED A COATAMUNDI. WE CALL HIMSNOOTIE FOR HIS UPPER LIP IS LONG AND STICKS OUT OVER HIS LOWER. HEIS LITTLE ALMOST AS A RAT WITH A FURRY LONG TAIL. BETTY HAS A BROWNPUPPY NAMED DYNASHORT SHE SAYS FOR DYNAMITE BILL WHO GAVE IT TOHER.GREGORY BATESON LEFT AT PANAMA AND TOOK MANY OF THE LIVE THINGS BACKWITH HIM TO NEW YORK. THE LIZARDS AND SMALLER THINGS DIED BUT THE PAIROF LOVELY ALBATROSSES LIVED AND I HOPE I SHALL SEE THEM WHEN I GO TOTHE ZOO. BATESON IS STILL A STUDENT AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY IN ENGLANDAND HIS FATHER IS A FAMOUS SCIENTIST.ON SATURDAY NIGHT LATE WE PULLED OUT OF THE DOCK AT PANAMA BUT WE HADTO WAIT ALL NEXT DAY AT ANCHOR IN THE OUTER HARBOR FOR TWO NEW FIREMEN.TWO OF OURS HAD LEFT AND NOT COME BACK TO THE BOAT. AND AS THE CAPTAINWANTED TO KEEP ALL THE REST OF THE CREW ABOARD WE STAYED OUT THERE SOMORE COULDNT LEAVE.COCOS ISLANDCOCOS ISLAND IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM PANAMA IN THE PACIFICOCEAN AND BELONGS TO THE COUNTRY OF COSTA RICA. FOUR TIMES A YEAR ITIS VISITED BY A GOVERNMENT BOAT FROM COSTA RICA.IT IS A STEEP HIGH ISLAND BRIGHT GREEN JUNGLE WITH FEW PROTECTEDCOVES OR BAYS. THE BEST ANCHORAGE IS CHATHAM BAY WHICH HAS SOME SHELTERWITH A BIG HIGH SOLID ROCK ISLAND TO THE WEST AND A SMALL ROCK ISLANDTO THE EAST SIDE. THE ONLY SETTLEMENT EVER MADE HERE WAS AROUND TWOBENDS OR COVES FROM CHATHAM BAY AT WAFER BAY. THE BEACH IS MOREBEAUTIFUL THERE AND THE SLOPE BEHIND THE BEACH IS EASIER TO CLIMBTHERE WAS MORE LEVEL GROUND TO CULTIVATE AND PLANT TO TREES ANDVEGETABLES. BUT THIS SECOND BAY IS NOT A SAFE HARBOR FOR A SHIP TO LIEIN OPEN AND WITH SQUALLS AND WINDS BLOWING ALL THE TIME AND ROLLERS ONTHE BEACH AT NEARLY EVERY HIGH TIDE.FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS A CAPTAIN GISSLER HIS WIFE AND SERVANTS LIVED ATTHIS WAFER BAY. HE SPENT HIS TIME MOSTLY LOOKING FOR TREASURE AND WESAW MANY DEEP HOLES WHICH HE PROBABLY HAD DUG. AS HE IS NOT HERE TODAYAND THE PLACE IS DESERTED MAYBE HE FOUND IT AND MOVED AWAY TO A LESSLONELY PLACE.PIRATES HAD BEEN HERE AND BURIED GOLD AND IT IS SAID THAT SOMETREASURE HAS BEEN FOUND AT DIFFERENT TIMES.THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL WATERFALLS. LOTS OF THEM TUMBLE RIGHT DOWNINTO THE SEA FROM THE STEEP CLIFFS AND FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS SHIPSHAVE COME HERE FOR FRESH WATER WHALERS AND PIRATES AND MERCHANT SHIPSOR TRAMPS. ONE STREAM EMPTIES RIGHT INTO THE BAY.THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL FERNS AND TREEFERNS AND TALL JUNGLE TREES.THE TANGLE OF VINES IS VERY THICK AND THE ONLY WAY TO GO INTO THEINTERIOR OF THE ISLAND AT ALL IS TO FOLLOW ALONG THE BEDS OF STREAMSAND CLIMB UP ROCKS AND WATERFALLS AND AROUND CASCADES FOR THE SIDES OFTHE BROOKS ARE LIKE SOLID WALLS AND THERE ARE NOT MANY PLACES WHERE YOUCAN GET UP.WE WENT UP A LOVELY STREAM BED ONE DAY FROM CHATHAM BAY. WE PULLEDOURSELVES UP ROCKS AND AROUND BAD PLACES AND STEPPED INTO DEEP POOLSSOMETIMES UP TO OUR NECKS. WE HAD GONE AT LEAST A MILE AND A HALF UPTHE RIVER CLIMBING STEADILY WHEN WE CAME TO A BEAUTIFUL LITTLECASCADE THAT FELL DOWN A CLIFF ABOUT SEVENTY FEET HIGH. I WAS CATCHINGSMALL BLUE CRAYFISH IN THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF IT WHEN I LOST MYBALANCE AND FELL DOWN ONTO A JAGGED ROCK.FOR A TIME I COULD HARDLY BEAR THE PAIN OF IT AND JUST SAT AND CRIED.MOTHER AND ISABEL AND BETTY WERE ALL AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN A LEGOR SOMETHING. THEY WERE AWFULLY WORRIED FOR WE WERE SO FAR FROM THESHORE AND HAD CLIMBED WATERFALLS ALL MORNING TO GET THERE. BUT IT WASONLY A TERRIBLY BAD BRUISE AND I WAS GLAD MOTHER WAS SO STRONG. SHE HADTO PRACTICALLY CARRY ME AND LOWER ME DOWN OVER ROCKS AND WATERFALLS ALLTHE WAY BACK. WE STOPPED TO EAT OUR LUNCH ON A LOVELY HUGE BOWLDER INTHE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN. AFTER RESTING A WHILE IFELT A LITTLE BETTER AND COULD HELP MYSELF GETTING DOWN HARD PLACES. ITWOULD BE AWFUL TO BREAK AN ARM OR A LEG OR EVEN TO SPRAIN ONES ANKLEIN SUCH A PLACE FOR EVEN A TRAIL IS IMPOSSIBLE THERE AND IT IS VERYHARD TO CARRY ANYONE DOWN SUCH A PLACE.MOTHER WAS PRETTY TIRED ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD A BAD SUNBURN ON HERBACK AND SHOULDERS AND I BROKE THE BLISTERS BY PUTTING MY ARMS AROUNDHER TO STEADY MYSELF AND SOMETIMES I EVEN HAD TO CLIMB DOWN HER BACKTO LOWER MYSELF FROM ONE HIGH ROCK TO ANOTHER SIX FEET BELOW.THE NIGHT BEFORE THIS TRIP UP THE RIVER WE HAD A FURIOUS GALE. THEWIND BLEW HARDER THAN I EVER FELT IT AND FOR A TIME THE RAIN CAME IN ASOLID MASS LIKE A WARM WET CURTAIN STREAMING ACROSS THE DECKS.EVERYTHING WAS SOAKED CHAIRS FELL OVER CURTAINS WERE TANGLED UPDOORS SLAMMED. AND THEN THE BOOBIES KEPT FLYING RIGHT INTO THE SHIPBANGING THEIR HEADS AND BODIES AGAINST THINGS AND STUNNING THEMSELVES.THEY DROPPED HEADLONG INTO THE LAB WHERE WE WERE SITTING THEY FELLTO THE FLOOR IN OUR CABINS IF THE DOORS WERE OPEN FOR A MINUTE AND ALLOVER THE DECKS THE POOR THINGS WERE CROUCHING AROUND SQUAWKING. ANDTHEY VOMITED UP FISH ALL OVER THE PLACE.THIS IS A CURIOUS HABIT WITH SOME BIRDS THEY SEEM TO DO IT AS AFORFEIT TO ANOTHER BIRD. THEY COUGH UP THEIR FOOD WHICH THE OTHER BIRDTHEN TAKES AS PAYMENT LEAVING THE STRANDED ONE ALONE WITHOUT PECKINGHIM. WHITEHEADED TERNS FLEW ABOARD TOO. WE WERE ALL OF US BUSYTHROWING THEM OVERBOARD.IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE GALE AND RAIN AND WIND THE FIVE ROWBOATSWHICH WERE OVER THE SIDE TIED TO THE BOOM BY LINES HAD TO BE BROUGHTON BOARD. A MATE STOOD ON THE TOP OF THE GANGWAY A LIFE PRESERVER ON ALONG LINE IN THE WATER IN CASE SOMEONE FELL OVERBOARD AND THEN ONE BYONE FIVE MEN WENT OUT ON THE BOOM TO THE END DOWN THE ROPE LADDERINTO A TANGLED UP AND BOUNCING BOAT AND THEN ROWED IT AFT TO BEHOISTED UP BY OTHER MEN ONTO THE SHIP. IT WAS ALL QUITE EXCITING AND ISTOOD IN THE RAIN A LONG TIME WATCHING.THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS ALL CALM AGAIN AND YOU COULDNT BELIEVE THEREHAD BEEN A SMALL HURRICANE THE NIGHT BEFORE.MAY TH MAY TWENTIETH IS MY BIRTHDAY AND MOTHER HAD MADE ME A WHOLE PIRATEOUTFITPANTALOON TROUSERS RED SASH CALICO HEAD SCARF A MACHETE ROPESOLED SHOES AND A RAGGED SHIRT.EVERYBODY MET AT UNCLE WILLS CABIN JUST BEFORE DINNER AND THEN TO THEPOUNDING OF A BIG DRUM WE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE DINING SALOONEVERYBODY DRESSED IN FULL PIRATE COSTUMES WITH WILD LOOKING WIGS ANDKNIVES AND CUTLASSES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION.I GOT TWO KNIVES A JAR OF JAM A BOX OF SWEET CRACKERS A COCOANUT AFINE PIECE OF OLD CHIRIQUI INDIAN POTTERY AND A PEACH OF A COLLECTINGBAG. LUMPY THE BAKER MADE ME A HUGE BIRTHDAY CAKE.THEN AFTER DINNER SHORTY TOOK A FLASHLIGHT PICTURE OF THE GANG AGAINSTTHE SHROUDS DOWN ON THE HATCH DECK. WE REALLY LOOKED LIKE A PIRATE CREWTOO WITH EVERYONE IN COSTUME AND APPARENTLY ON A SAILING SHIP. THESTEEP ROCKY ISLAND NEAR THE NORTH POINT OF CHATHAM BAY SHOWED IN THEBACKGROUND AND MADE IT SEEM EVEN MORE REAL.THE NIGHT OF THE BIRTHDAY PARTY DON DICKERMAN WORE HIS MAROONED MANCOSTUME. IT IS ENTIRELY RAGS AND TATTERS AND MENDED WITH BITS OF OLDSTRING AND LEATHER. WITH A WIG OF TANGLED HAIR ALL KNOTTED AND ABANDANNA AND A CUTLASS HE LOOKS PRETTY AWFUL. JOHN TEE VAN HAD TORNTROUSERS BARE BODY A FRIGHTFUL LONG BLACK WIG AND HE PAINTED ON ATERRIBLE SCAR ACROSS HIS FACE AND SLASHES OF BLOOD ON HIS INSTEPS.SOME OF THE OTHERS HAD FINE CLOTHES OF VELVET WITH OLD LACE THE RICHPIRATES OR THOSE WHO HAD STOLEN BOOTY FROM SOME RECENT CAPTIVE. AND THEGIRLS LOOKED LIKE PIRATES WIVES OR SWEETHEARTS EXCEPT MOTHER WHO CAMEAS A WILD WOMAN MY CAPTIVE ALL BOUND UP WITH ROPES AND BEING DRAGGEDALONG.ABOUT THE GRANDEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT ONE COULD GET WAS GIVEN ME BY DON.IT WAS HIS FAVORITE SWORD A REAL OLD TIME CUTLASS WHICH PERHAPS WASUSED BY PIRATES. HE CALLED IT FURY AND GOT UP AN AWFULLY FUNNY CARDTO GO WITH IT.AND DWIGHT FRANKLIN MADE ME A LOVELY DRAWING OF THE BEACH AT COCOS BACKIN THE OLD DAYS WITH A REGULAR PIRATE LANDING ON IT FROM HIS SHIP.THAT PICTURE IS USED AT THE END OF MY BOOK.COCOS ISLAND IS REALLY A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR A PIRATE PARTY ANYWAY FORREAL PIRATES WERE THERE MANY TIMES AND MAYBE MEN WERE MAROONED THEREOR LEFT THERE AND MUTINIES OCCURRED. TREASURE WAS BURIED THERE. ALONGTHE BEACH WHERE SHIPS CAME FOR FRESH WATER THERE ARE CARVINGS ON THEROCKS SHIPS NAMES AND DATES MANY OF THEM OLD AND BACK AS FAR AS. THERE WERE NAMES OF FAMOUS WHALING SHIPS AND ONE THE SHREW WASA REAL PIRATE SHIP BUT THE DATE WAS NOT GIVEN WITH THAT ONE PROBABLYON PURPOSE.THERE IS A FINE TUNNEL RIGHT THROUGH THE ROCK IN ONE PLACE GOING FULLYA HUNDRED YARDS THROUGH A POINT OF LAND TO ANOTHER BAY QUITE ROUND THECORNER. DON WENT THROUGH IT IN HIS LITTLE DUGOUT CANOE WHICH HE BOUGHTIN PANAMA AND TAMMS THE THIRD MATE WENT IN HIS MOTOR SKIFF WITH THEJOHNSON ENGINE.IN ONE LITTLE BAY BEYOND THE SETTLEMENT WE FOUND A HOLE TWENTY FEETDEEP WHERE CAPTAIN GISSLER OR SOMEONE ELSE HAD DUG FOR TREASURE. DONAND DWIGHT WENT DOWN IT ON A ROPE AND ONLY FOUND A BOARD AND A PIECE OFROPE THERE.WEEKS AT SEAFOR TWO WEEKS AFTER LEAVING COCOS ISLAND WE WERE AT SEA AGAIN. THEDAILY SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN THE TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER AND SAMPLESAND THEN THERE WERE THE NETS. WE HAD OUT THE BIG OTTER TRAWL NET TO GOTO THE BOTTOM EVERY DAY UNTIL WE LOST IT BY GETTING IT TANGLED IN THEPROPELLER OVER THE STERN. AND THE LONG EIGHTFOOT NET TO GO TO BOTTOMWE ALSO LOST PROBABLY BECAUSE IT HIT A SUBMERGED MOUNTAIN PEAK OR AHUGE ROCK.BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS OTHER NETS THE ONE METRE NET THE HALF METRE ANDTHE BLAKE DREDGE. A METRE IS A LITTLE OVER THREE FEET. ONCE IN THEMORNING AND ONCE EVERY AFTERNOON THESE WENT OVER AND THERE WAS ALWAYSGREAT EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT. THERE WERE SOME FINE RICH HAULS.IN ABOUT THE BEST HAUL THERE WERE TWO TUBS OF DEEP SEA FISH FROMBOTTOMBLACK AND QUEER LOOKING SOME WITH LONG POINTED TAILS WITHOUT ATAIL FIN SOME EELS BLACK WITH POINTED HEADS AND A LOT OF FUNNYLITTLE FISH LIKE SHARKS ONLY WITH BRIGHT GREEN EYES. MANY OF THESE COMETO THE SURFACE WITH THE SCALES ALL TORN OFF OR SOFT AND PEELING.THERE WERE LIGHT PINK STARFISH VERY BRITTLE A FEW SEA CUCUMBERS SOMELIVING SPONGES CRABS BRIGHT RED SHRIMPS AND TWO OR THREE VERY QUEERLOOKING FISH WITH FACES LIKE DEMONS OR BOGEYS WITH FUNNY LITTLEELECTRIC LIGHT THINGS STICKING OUT IN FRONT OF THEM ON LONG BARBELSWHICH IS WHAT THEY CALL THE LONG WHISKERLIKE THING.I BROUGHT HOME FOR MY COLLECTION A FEW SPECIMENS OF THIS RARE DEEP SEALIFE. STARFISH SHRIMP AND CYCLOTHONE WHICH IS A SMALL DEEP SEA FISH.APPARENTLY THERE IS A GREAT UNDERSEA PLATEAU AROUND COCOS. IT IS ABOUTSIX HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP. JUST OFF THE EDGE OF THIS IT IS THIRTEEN TOSIXTEEN HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP.FOR DAYS WE SAW MANY OCEAN TUNNIE FISH JUMPING NEAR THE SHIP AND WETRIED ALL KINDS OF BAITS AND DIFFERENT SPOONS AND SQUIDS TO CATCH THEM.ONE DAY MOTHER FINALLY GOT FOUR OF THEM BY JERKING A SQUID UP AND DOWNFROM OFF THE BOOM. THEY WEIGHED FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN POUNDS AND ITCERTAINLY WAS VERY GOOD TO HAVE FRESH FISH FOR BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING.THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL FISH LIKE A TORPEDO OR BULLET SHAPED WITH LOVELYDARK BLUE BACKS AND PINKISH SILVERY SIDES WITH FOUR STRIPES BELOW THEMIDDLE LINE AND THEY ARE VERY SWIFT SWIMMERS MOVING AS FAST OR FASTERTHAN THE SHIP FOR HOURS AT A TIME.ONE DAY I WAS SITTING ON THE RAIL PREPARING A FISH SKELETON ANDSUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOUD PWISHSHSH RIGHT NEAR ME. MACK THE FIRSTMATE CALLED OUT WHALE AND I JUMPED UP AND SAW HIM NOT FIFTEEN FEETAWAY. A BIG BLACK BODY ABOUT FORTY FEET LONG.ANOTHER DAY WE SAW A WHOLE SCHOOL OF BIG BLACKFISH A KIND OF SMALLWHALE AND THEY ALSO WERE RIGHT NEAR THE BOAT FOR AN HOUR. THEY FIRSTLOOK LIKE HUGE SLOW PORPOISES COMING SLOWLY TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE.THEY ARE BLACK WITH ROUNDED SNOUTS AND A BIG HUGE FIN SOMETHING LIKEA SHARKS ON THE BACK.DURING THIS TIME AT SEA SHORTY AND I MADE A CUTE LITTLE DOG HOUSE FORBETTYS PUPPY DYNA. IT IS WHITE WITH A RED ROOF AND A LITTLE GABLEOVER THE DOOR WITH A SIGN BEWARE OF THE DOG. SHORTY SCHOEDSACK ISTHE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WENT WITH MY FRIEND COLONEL COOPER TO PERSIA ANDTOOK THE WONDERFUL MOVIE GRASS. HE IS CALLED SHORTY BECAUSE HE ISABOUT SIX FEET SIX INCHES TALL.WE HAD ROUGH SEAS AND CONSTANT RAINS ALMOST ALL THE TIME OUT HEREPERHAPS BECAUSE WE WERE STILL SO CLOSE TO THE COCOS ISLANDS. BUT IT HASMEANT WE COULD NOT GO OVER THE SIDE FOR A SWIM OR EVEN PUT OUT THELITTLE MOTOR SKIFF FOR GAME FISHING OR TROLLING.TAGUS COVEHALF A MINUTE SOUTH OF THE EQUATORTAGUS COVE IS ON THE WEST SIDE OF ALBEMARLE ISLAND A DEEP LITTLE BAYABOUT HALF A MILE WIDE. THE CLIFFS AROUND IT ARE STEEP EXCEPT FOR ONEPLACE AT THE END WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE GULLY IN THE ROCKS. THERE ISNO BEACH SO WE LANDED IN THIS GULLY WHERE THE ROCKS WERE VERYSLIPPERY.WHEN YOU ARE ONCE ASHORE HOWEVER IT IS FAIRLY EASY WALKING BECAUSETHE LAVA IS VERY OLD AND CRUMBLY LIKE CLINKERS AND THE SCRUBBY BUSHESAND STUMPY TREES GIVE ONE A HOLD.OVER THE NEAREST AND LOWEST RIDGE THERE IS A LITTLE CRATER LAKE ANDNEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO CHARLES DARWIN CLIMBED UP AND DISCOVEREDIT WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND HERE IN THE BEAGLE.THERE IS A FIVEMILE CHANNEL ACROSS TO NARBOROUGH ISLAND WHICH IS AHUGE VOLCANO WITH SIDES ALMOST ENTIRELY BLACK WITH LAVA RIGHT DOWN TOTHE SEA.DON AND I WERE ALMOST THE FIRST ONES ASHORE AND WE FOUND A SMALL SEALION RIGHT IN THE ROCK GULLY ASLEEP. WE TIED A ROPE TO HIM AND PLAYEDWITH HIM QUITE A WHILE BEFORE DON TOOK HIM BACK TO THE SHIP.SERGE TOOK ME WITH HIM COLLECTING AND WE SCRAMBLED OVER TWO OR THREEHILLS. I CAUGHT A TWOINCH SCORPION UNDER A ROCK AND QUITE A FEW BIGGRASSHOPPERS AND MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES. SERGE IS A RUSSIAN WHOSE LASTNAME IS CHETYRKIN. HE SPEAKS VERY LITTLE ENGLISH BUT IS A FINETAXIDERMIST. HIS JOB IS TO PRESERVE AND MOUNT BIRDS AND FISH. HEMOUNTED FOR ME MY LITTLE PET PENGUIN WHICH DIED AFTER WE HAD HIM ABOARDFOR NEARLY A MONTH. HE WAS AN AWFULLY FUNNY LITTLE BIRD AS TAME ANDFRIENDLY AS COULD BE. WED PUT SMALL LIVE FISH IN A GLASS TANK AND THENWATCH HIM CATCH THEM FOR THESE PENGUINS ARE WONDERFUL DIVERS ANDSWIMMERS. I THINK THEIR ENTIRE FOOD IS FISH. AND THAT WAS THE WAY MYPET GOT HIS EXERCISE AND HIS DINNER AT THE SAME TIME.ANOTHER DAY DON AND I FISHED RIGHT OFF SHORE NEAR THE LANDING PLACEAND GOT MANY FINE FISH ONE ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL ONE ALL BRIGHT ORANGEAND BLACK WITH A BIG BUMP OVER HIS NOSE. AND ONCE WHEN WE LEFT A STRINGOF NEW SPECIMENS IN THE WATER TO KEEP THEM ALIVE A SHARK CAME RIGHT UPAND BIT ONE OFF THE STRINGTHE VERY FIRST DAY IN TAGUS MOTHER AND THE DOCTOR WENT OUT FISHING ANDTHEY BROUGHT IN THE FINEST LOT OF GAME FISH WE HAD THE WHOLE TRIPBIGMACKEREL GROUPERS BONITO TUNA AND BARRACUDA.BETTY WANTED TO GET UP HIGH ENOUGH ON THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES TO SEE ACROSSTO THE VOLCANO WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND. IT WAS THE SAMEONE WE HAD SEEN IN ERUPTION SEVEN WEEKS EARLIER. SHE LEFT THE SHIP ATFIVE IN THE MORNING AND WAS CLIMBING ALL DAY TILL EVENING. SHE DID GETUP BEYOND THE CLOUDS AND THEN HAD TO GO BY COMPASS. THERE WAS DAMP WETGRASS AND VEGETATION UP THERE ALTHOUGH THE LOWER SLOPES HAD ALL BEENDRY LAVA AND BURNED BUNCHES OF GRASSY STUFF. SHE SAW FRESH TORTOISETRACKS AND WANTED TO FOLLOW ON BUT SHE KNEW EVERYONE ON THE SHIP WOULDWORRY IF SHE DID NOT COME BACK AND SO SHE HAD TO LEAVE TO CLIMB DOWNAGAIN. SHE WENT ALL ALONE.MOTHER AND ISABEL TOOK A HARD CLIMB IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OVER TWOHIGH HILLS AND THEY SAW A VERY MUCH BIGGER CRATER LAKE WHICH HAD NEVERBEEN REPORTED BEFORE. IT HAD VERY STEEP WALLS OVER FIVE HUNDRED FEETHIGH AND SIX LITTLE CONELIKE ISLANDS IN THE MIDDLE.ALONG THE SHORES OF THE COVE THERE ARE GROTTOES AND LITTLE CAVES ANDHERE THERE ARE PENGUINS AND PELICANS AND BOOBIES AND SOME VERYSTRANGE BIRDS CALLED FLIGHTLESS CORMORANTSBIRDS WHICH REALLY HAVE LOSTTHE POWER OF FLIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIVED SO LONG ON THE ISLAND ANDNEVER REALLY USED THEIR WINGS BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE TO GET FOOD ORTRAVEL ANYWHERE.THE GIANT DEVIL FISHTWO DAYS AFTER LEAVING TAGUS WE WERE CRUISING AROUND ALONG THE SHORESOF NARBOROUGH ISLAND TRAWLING WITH THE NETS.TWO OR THREE SKIFFS WERE NEAR SHORE SOME DIVING SOME FISHING ANDOTHERS DYNAMITING. MOTHER AND DOCTOR CADY WERE TROLLING FOR BIG FISHAND SUDDENLY MOTHER HAD A TERRIFIC HARD PULL AND FOR HALF AN HOUR SHEHAD TO PLAY A TUNA. IT WAS  INCHES LONG AND WEIGHED  POUNDS.SOON AFTER THEY SAW A GREAT LONG FIN MOVING SLOWLY ALONG AND WHEN THEYCAME NEAR FOUND A BIG FLAT FISH LIKE A SKATE SLOWLY SKIMMING JUSTBELOW THE SURFACE SO THAT ONLY HIS TWO FINS CAME ABOVE THE WATER. THEYFOLLOWED HIM AROUND AND ACTUALLY HERDED HIM OVER TOWARDS BILL ANDDWIGHT IN ANOTHER BOAT.NEXT MORNING DON AND DWIGHT AND DOC WENT OUT TO FIND ONE WITH TWOHARPOONS PLENTY OF ROPE AND TWO KEGS. THEY CRUISED AROUND A LITTLE ANDSOON SAW A BIG RIPPLE ON THE WATER A RAY GOING ALONG WITH HIS FINSSTICKING UP IN THE AIR TWENTY INCHES.THEY STRUCK WITH THEIR HARPOONS AND AFTER A GREAT SPLASH THE BIG RAYJUST SANK OUT OF SIGHT AND PULLED THE ROPE AND TWO KEGS RIGHT DOWN WITHHIM. THEY WAITED A LONG TIME AND WATCHED FOR HIM TO RISE BUT WHEN WECAME ALONG IN THE LAUNCH PAWNEE WE SAID WE WOULD STAY TO LOOK WHILETHEY WENT TO THE SHIP FOR ANOTHER HARPOONING OUTFIT. WE CHASED ANOTHERBIG RAY FOR ALMOST HALF A MILE BEFORE THE OTHERS CAME BACK.DWIGHT TOOK FIRST SHOT BUT THE HARPOON SOON PULLED OUT AND THE BIGFISH WENT SAILING ALONG THE SURFACE AGAIN. THEN DON TOOK A SHOT WHICHHELD AND HE PLAYED OUT THE ROPE HOLDING ON TO THE END SO THAT THE RAYHAD TO TOW THE BOAT.MEANWHILE BILL HAD COME ALONG IN ANOTHER SKIFF TO SEE THE EXCITEMENT.BILL GAVE THEM A SECOND HARPOON WHICH DWIGHT STUCK IN AND THEN THE FISHTOWED THE TWO BOATS FOR A TIME EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE FLIPPING UP ITSTAIL AND HUNCHING ITS BACK TO TRY TO SWEEP OFF THE ROPES AND HARPOONS.GRADUALLY IT SWAM BACK TOWARDS THE SHIP AND THE MEN STARTED THEIRENGINE AND FORCED IT OVER THAT WAY. WHEN IT WAS QUITE NEAR WE HURRIEDTO THE BOAT TO GET THE MOVIE CAMERA FOR SHORTY AND I BROUGHT DWIGHTSREVOLVER TO HIM. HE SHOT IT FIVE TIMES WITH A THIRTYEIGHT AND BILLPUT IN FIVE LOADS OF HEAVY BUCK SHOT. THEN IT SEEMED TO MAKE A GREATEFFORT AND TRIED TO SWIM DOWN DEEP. DON HELD IT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTHAND WOULD NOT LET IT GO STRAIGHT DOWN. IT FLIPPED ITS WING AND HIT DONRIGHT ACROSS THE SHOULDER AND HEAD TWICE BUT HE NEVER LET GO. THEN ITTRIED TO SPILL OVER THE BOAT BY GETTING RIGHT UNDER IT. BUT FINALLYTHEY TOWED IT NEAR ENOUGH FOR THE SAILORS TO THROW A ROPE DOWN AND GETA LINE OVER IT.IT HAD BEEN BLEEDING PRETTY HEAVILY AND THERE WAS A BIG TRAIL OF BLOODALL THE WAY TO THE SHORE AND SOME SHARKS WERE FOLLOWING THIS UP.IT MEASURED EIGHTEEN FEET ACROSS FROM WING TO WING AND WEIGHED POUNDS. AND AFTER THEY STARTED DISSECTING IT THEY FOUND AN UNBORN RAYTHAT WEIGHED  POUNDS AND MADE A PERFECT SPECIMEN TO PRESERVE AND TAKEBACK TO THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.MOLTEN LAVAWE WERE SAILING ALONG THE EAST COAST OF ALBEMARLE ISLAND FOR WE WANTEDTO KNOW IF THE VOLCANO WE HAD SEEN IN ERUPTION ON EASTER SUNDAY NEARLYTWO MONTHS BEFORE WAS STILL IN ERUPTION. WE WERE ALMOST THEREPRACTICALLY ON THE EQUATOR AND WE RECOGNIZED THE COLUMNS OF SMOKE HALFWAY UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.SUDDENLY A YELL CAME FROM THE BRIDGE AND THE MATE BLEW THE FOGHORNWHICH IS THE WAY WE ARE CALLED TO HURRY TO SEE SOMETHING AND WHEN WECAME RUNNING OUT WE SAW A HIGH FUNNEL OF BRIGHT WHITE SMOKE RISINGRIGHT OUT OF THE SEA DOWN AT THE END OF A POINT A FEW MILES AHEAD OFUS. IT COULDNT BE SPRAY FOR IT WAS TOO ENORMOUSLY HIGH AND KEPT RIGHTIN ONE PLACE.UNCLE WILL THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME IT MUST BE A GEYSER OR SMALL VOLCANORIGHT AT THE WATERS EDGE. AND EVERYBODY WATCHED IT THROUGH GLASSES ANDCLIMBED UP INTO THE CROWSNEST FOR A BETTER VIEW. BUT WHEN WE CAMEALONG CLOSER WE COULD EASILY SEE IT WAS A GREAT FIELD OF HOT LAVA WHICHHAD REACHED THE SEA AND WAS POURING INTO THE COLD WATER. FOR A WHILEBEFORE WE REACHED THERE WE COULD SEE A STREAK OF DULL GREEN IN THEWATER QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE DARK INDIGO BLUE MAKING A VERY CLEARLINE BETWEEN THE TWO. AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WENT UP FROM THENORMAL  DEGREES WHICH WE HAD HAD RIGHT ALONG TO  DEGREES AND EVENTHAT WAS A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY FROM THE SHORE.LUCKILY THE STRONG ONSHORE WIND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO GO VERYCLOSE AND NOT RUN ANY DANGER OF GETTING IN POISONOUS GASES OR SMOKEFOR THERE WERE GREAT CLOUDS OF SMOKE.THE SHORE ROCKS WERE BLACK THERE WERE TWO COLORS IN THE WATER GREENCLOSE TO SHORE AND BLUE OUT BEYOND AND THESE BIG MASSES OF VERY WHITESTEAMY SMOKE. AND THEN AS WE CAME CLOSER WE COULD SEE HUGE OPENINGS ATTHE END OF THE LAVA FLOW LIKE PIPES EMPTYING RED HOT LAVA OUT INTO THEWATER. IT LOOKED LIKE BRIGHT BLOOD.ALL DAY TILL DARK WE CIRCLED AROUND AND KEPT PASSING NEAR IT KEEPINGABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM SHORE. THERE WERE HIGH WAVES AND ASTRONG BREEZE AND THE SMOKE WAS BLOWING STEADILY UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDESO THAT BY SUNSET TIME WE COULDNT SEE THE LITTLE CONES UP ON THEHIGHER SLOPES FROM WHICH THE WHOLE FLOW HAD COME DOWN.BUT AFTER DARK WE COULD TELL JUST THE LINE THE STREAM HAD FLOWED DOWNA RATHER ZIGZAG COURSE AND RIGHT OVER THE PLACE TO WHICH UNCLE WILLAND JOHN HAD CLIMBED TWO MONTHS EARLIER. THERE WERE GREAT HOT PATCHESWHICH GLOWED RED IN THE DARK AND LITTLE SPECKS OF HOT FIERY PLACES ALLALONG THE SLOPES. AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT AT THE SHORE THESEGREAT HUGE OPEN HOT RED STREAMS SPILLING OUT INTO THE SEA. ONCE ORTWICE IT WOULD BREAK OUT IN BIGGER FLOWS OR WHOLE BIG CHUNKS WOULD FALLOFF INTO THE WATER AND THEN IT WOULD SHOOT OUT AND THROW BOILING LAVAINTO THE AIR WAY UP LIKE BLASTING OR SKYROCKETS.THROUGH THE GLASSES WE COULD SEE SEVERAL BIRDS WHICH HAD FLOWN TOO NEARAND THEIR BODIES WERE FLOATING ALONG IN THE WATER. ONCE WE SAW A POORSEA LION THROW HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR FIVE TIMES AND THENFLOP DOWN DEAD RIGHT NEAR THE TERRIBLE STREAM. A GREAT BIG OCTOPUSFLOATED BY JUST ABOUT DEAD. AND WE WATCHED A WHOLE WAVE SO FULL OFFISH IT LOOKED BLACK SWIMMING AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY COULD STRAIGHTOUT TO THE COLD WATER. ONCE TOO WE SAW A SHARK IN A KIND OF DAZESWIMMING ALONG AND PROBABLY NOT KNOWING WHY THE WATER WAS SO SUDDENLYGROWING HOTTER AND HOTTER.SHORTY TOOK SOME FINE PICTURES OF THE WHOLE THING THE SMOKE SPURTINGUP IN THE AIR THE PIECES OF ROCK CRUNCHING OFF AND EXPLODING INTO THEWATER AND THE GREAT STREAMS OF MELTED ROCK.THE LAST THING AT NIGHT WHEN WE LEFT WE SAW SIX BIG OUTLETS OR HOTGLOWING SPOUTS DIMMER AND DIMMER AS WE TURNED EASTWARD. NEXT MORNING WELEFT THE GALPAGOS ISLANDS FOR PANAMA.A LITTLE SONG WRITTEN BY DON DICKERMAN FORDAVIDS BIRTHDAY PARTY    SONG TO DAVIE PUTNAM    OH HIS NAME WAS DAVIE PUTNAM    AND THE YOUNGEST MAN ABOARD    IN TRUTH WE GUESSED THEY SHIPPED HIM FOR A LARK.    DIDNT NEED NO POWDER MONKEY    GUESTS WE COULDNT QUITE AFFORD    BUT HE SAILED WITH WILLIAM BEEBE ON THE ARK.    OH WE TOOK THIS DAVIE PUTNAM    AND WE SAILED AWAY I SAY    TO THOSE DESERT ISLANDS CRUEL BLEAK AND STARK.    THERE WE CAPTURED GIANT LIZARDS    SHARKS AND TORTOISE IN THE BAY    AS WE SAILED WITH WILLIAM BEEBE IN THE ARK.    AND THIS LITTLE DAVIE PUTNAM    WHO WAS ONLY TWELVE YSEE    WITH HIS MATES THOME AFRISKIN IN THE PARK    STEPS OUT WITH ALL HIS OLDERS    HUNTS AND FISHES WITH THE BEST    AS HE SAILED WITH WILLIAM BEEBE IN THE ARK.    SO THIS LITTLE DAVIE PUTNAM    SMALLEST MAN ABOARD THE SHIP    AS THE TOPMOST FIGHTIN PIRATE MAKES HIS MARK    AND BESIDES WE LIKED HIS SPIRIT    AND HIS MANY A MERRY QUIP    AS WE SAILED WITH WILLIAM BEEBE ON THE ARK.\n"
