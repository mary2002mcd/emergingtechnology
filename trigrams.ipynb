      "nature of an apology or a panegyric,—and in fact any direct reference\n",
      "to the subject of the volume in which it is printed is in the nature of\n",

      "keep the heat of the sun from my head (and in the tropics this is very\n",
      "important, especially to protect the back of the neck from the sun).\n",
      "Also I like to have a gig or spear with which I can get some of the\n",
      "kinds of fish which do not bite at bait.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main idea is to get birds’ eggs. Gulls’ nests are mostly on the\n",
      "rocks of the cliffs, doves build on the lava rock on the ground or in\n",
      "little crevasses, mocking birds in low bushes or the cactus trees or\n",
      "shrubs, and the big boobies and frigate birds make ugly twig nests\n",
      "about two or three feet from the ground, the greater number of them\n",
      "nearer the shore, although I did see some on my way up to the crater\n",
      "lake that Dwight had discovered in the center of the island, and these\n",
      "were in higher trees. There was one big nest right on the lava rock\n",
      "under a tree. It was a green heron’s nest and the three half grown\n",
      "birds walked out of the nest when I came near.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day I speared two crawfish in a pool right near shore, but the\n",
      "prongs of the gig were too short to hold them and they got free and\n",
      "darted away. I lost a moray, or poisonous eel the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we swim at the beaches or in the ocean pools near the shore we\n",
      "have to watch out for sharks, sting rays and morays.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day at Tower Island, I went to climb the cliff for birds’ eggs. I\n",
      "took two boxes of soft cotton for packing any eggs I might find. And as\n",
      "I went along I tapped the ground to make the small birds fly up from\n",
      "their nests. This way I could locate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a mocking bird’s nest, took one egg, got some frigate eggs and\n",
      "a gull’s egg. Then I turned to come back and I could not remember the\n",
      "way. So I made for the cliff and the sea and came along till I found a\n",
      "place to climb down again over the huge boulders of loose lava rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frigate nests were near the shore. Their eggs are about the size of\n",
      "a hen’s egg, quite white. The Galápagos gulls’ eggs are smaller. And\n",
      "the boobies’ eggs are like the frigates’ only a little smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "After hunting for birds’ eggs I thought I would go over to see what Lin\n",
      "was doing in the big shallow pools across the beach. She was fishing\n",
      "with a tiny hook and line. So I tried, too, and I caught a lovely\n",
      "little blue and silvery fish about four inches long. It had small white\n",
      "speckles and was a new species. There are many different kinds of fish\n",
      "in these little pools, whole schools of them, varying from one to\n",
      "eighteen inches long and some with very lovely colors, many having\n",
      "stripes of gold and silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later I speared a whole collecting bag full of crabs for Mother to use\n",
      "as bait for her fishing out in the inlet. The black lava rocks are just\n",
      "full of bright colored crabs crawling around ... thousands of small\n",
      "black ones, speckled, and lighter color sandy ones, and great big\n",
      "bright red ones. Evidently they are all chasing each other all the\n",
      "time, and acting like cannibals. And then the rest of the time the\n",
      "birds are swooping down and snatching one. They certainly scurry the\n",
      "minute a shadow appears, and dart up and down the rocks so quickly it\n",
      "is hard to catch them.\n",

      "\n",
      "This tall helmet is made of thick brass with a triangle shaped glass\n",
      "window in the front. It fits on the shoulders and there is an air space\n",
      "inside so one can breathe. Then fresh air is pumped in by a hand pump,\n",

      "especially in the ears. They buzz and hurt as though someone was\n",

      "equalize the pressure, the same as going down in a high elevator.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is air in front of your eyes so you can see just as perfectly as\n",

      "silvery or striped ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day as Uncle Will entered the water, and was just going down, a\n",
      "huge shark swam by. He waited a few minutes and then went down, and the\n",
      "shark had apparently gone along on his business. Later he had a cage\n",
      "built, so he could stay in that and look around if there were too many\n",
      "sharks.\n",
      "\n",
      "That afternoon when he went down he saw many very strange fish, some\n",
      "bright orange and black with a white cross like a belt, others dark\n",
      "gray with yellow tails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there is always a chance in these waters to see octopus, big\n",

      "\n",
      "One day I went down. I was a little scared because the helmet weighs\n",
      "forty pounds or more and the stuffy feeling of having something over\n",
      "one’s head is unpleasant. I went over the stern of a rowboat in about\n",
      "fifteen feet of water near shore, and climbed down a heavy iron ladder,\n",
      "holding onto the rounds. There is a kind of roar from the air coming\n",
      "in, and a curious feeling against the ears, but otherwise it is grand\n",

      "hard on the oars till they came to a small beach to land on. They\n",
      "fairly ran up the beach to try to find water for they were all\n",

      "southerly of all the islands. It is low-lying with two or three rather\n",
      "higher hills and at the south end an albatross rookery which shows way\n",
      "out at sea, a high rocky headland, with the birds showing white against\n",
      "the black rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the other islands there is little known about Hood. There\n",
      "are lots of sea lions on the beaches and in the coves around the rocks.\n",
      "You may get almost close enough to touch them. Isabel Cooper, who is\n",
      "not afraid of anything, crept near enough to pat one old bull on the\n",
      "flipper. When she laughed aloud he gave a curious grunt and slid into\n",
      "the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "We noticed that several of the sea lions had eye disease, many of the\n",
      "little pups being entirely blind, and the older ones having perhaps one\n",
      "eye dimmed with a white film. So Bill Merriam shot one of them, brought\n",
      "it to the boat, and the doctor took the eyes out to study the sickness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went ashore with the crew one day, and we got a huge log which was\n",
      "covered with barnacles. We pushed it back into the water again and\n",
      "played with it, diving and climbing over it and fooling with it as we\n",
      "would a raft at home. The water is beautifully clear, the white sand\n",
      "and the black rocks showing up perfectly clearly for many feet deep. Of\n",
      "course we were all terribly scratched with rough housing, but it was\n",
      "good fun and fine exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lifted up some of the black rocks along the beach at low tide and\n",
      "found a small octopus. Someone took him out of the jar I had put him\n",
      "into to look at him and left him in the sun, so he died. But he was\n",
      "valuable as a specimen on the ship and has been put with the other jars\n",

      "covered with very sticky paste. He whistles the song of the bird, and\n",
      "when it comes to see who it is, John hits him on the back a light tap\n",

      "fish were very plentiful, and a large size—ten or twelve inches long,\n",
      "with lovely pinkish purple wings or fins. One night I harpooned enough\n",
      "for breakfast for the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish seem to get quite crazy with the light and they dart around\n",
      "cracking themselves against the boats and the shipside. To add to the\n",
