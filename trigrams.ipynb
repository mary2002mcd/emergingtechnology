      "Mr. George Putnam has asked me to write a solemn foreword to David’s\n",
      "book. An ideal foreword cannot be too brief, should never be in the\n",
      "nature of an apology or a panegyric,—and in fact any direct reference\n",
      "to the subject of the volume in which it is printed is in the nature of\n",
      "redundancy. Its only use, as far as I can see, is a chance to exploit\n",

      "dolphin.\n",

      "I wanted to see the immediate result of a temporary shift from school\n",

      "immediate personal reactions between David, myself and our gorgeous\n",
      "environment I can speak only with sheer enjoyment. Neither of us ever\n",
      "tired of exeleutherostomizing at every new thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the sifting of all these impressions, their reclothing in words\n",

      "\n",
      "I had my twelfth birthday on the Arcturus down on the Equator. And I\n",
      "know how lucky I was to be taken along. It was great fun. And I think I\n",
      "learned a lot, though perhaps it will hurt my school work, being away\n",
      "and everything. Anyway, Mother and I joined the Arcturus—Uncle Will’s\n",
      "ship—at Panama. We spent nearly three months in the Pacific Ocean,\n",
      "studying sea life and visiting seven uninhabited desert islands. And I\n",
      "promised Dad to write a little story about it all. He told me to try to\n",
      "tell what we did and what I saw just like fellows telling each other\n",
      "about their adventures. That’s pretty hard to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then when I got back they let me make this little book out of what I\n",
      "wrote most every day on the boat. It’s meant for boys and girls. Mother\n",
      "helped me fix up the spelling and make the grammar right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing took quite a long time, and I think being a naturalist\n",
      "would be more fun than being a writer. Anyway, my stories help me\n",
      "remember the fun we had on the Arcturus. I don’t see how it could have\n",
      "been much better.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived in Colon from New York and Havana early in the morning of\n",
      "March 27th, and after our inspection, Capt. Lane took us in his own\n",
      "launch over to the Arcturus—a high white ship which was lying across\n",
      "the harbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Arcturus, the boat on which we are to take our trip, is named for\n",
      "the great star which sailors use as a guiding star in sailing strange\n",
      "seas. She was fitted out by men who are interested in the New York\n",
      "Zoological Society, which has the wonderful Zoo in the Bronx. Among the\n",
      "living animals collected for the Zoo are albatrosses, flightless\n",
      "cormorants (a very rare bird), boobies and penguins. A great many\n",
      "specimens were to go to the American Museum of Natural History and fish\n",
      "to the Aquarium at the Battery. She is fitted with a whole outfit for a\n",
      "scientific expedition. At first sight she looked like a freighter, high\n",
      "sided and built for cargo, with many booms and cables and equipment for\n",
      "hoisting and moving things.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two laboratories in the forward part, the lower one fitted\n",
      "with bottles, microscopes, modelling clay and all sorts of glass jars\n",
      "in which to preserve specimens. The upper room is more of a library\n",
      "with reference books and text books on all subjects about oceanography,\n",
      "for this is an expedition mostly to study about the sea and the strange\n",
      "creatures in it. Also there is a chemical laboratory so that the blood\n",
      "of fishes can be examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bridge, or main part of the ship, is built up of five decks, and\n",
      "the members of the expedition have cabins here. The crew’s sleeping\n",
      "quarters are in the after part of the ship, and many of the men have\n",
      "hammocks hung up under the awning there, in which they sleep at night,\n",
      "or lie around in the day time.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the port side of the ship there is a special boom that goes out over\n",
      "the side. On ships the word “port” means left, and “starboard” means\n",
      "right. You never say back or front, but “aft” or “forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This boom has two railings tied to the bottom plank so one can walk out\n",
      "there and fish or haul in nets or go down the rope ladder. Sometimes\n",
      "when the ship rolls a lot the end goes right under the water. And out\n",
      "from the bow a pulpit is hung, a strong wire cage-like thing in which\n",
      "we can stand for harpooning or catching floating objects as we pass. To\n",
      "get down to the pulpit you climb down a rope ladder. When it’s rough\n",
      "it’s pretty exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the forward part of the ship there are two rooms fitted out as\n",
      "shops, one belonging to Bill Merriam the general handy man, who always\n",
      "mends the nets, shapes a new dredge, puts another seat in one of the\n",
      "rowboats, makes a lobster pot or fixes the motor boats. The other is a\n",
      "workshop for Serge the taxidermist and for Dwight Franklin the\n",
      "sculptor. Dwight makes wax moulds and plaster casts of fishes and\n",
      "preserves them, as well as making drawings and paintings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabel Cooper is the scientific artist. She has been on many other\n",
      "expeditions and made many wonderful pictures. On this trip she did over\n",
      "two hundred water color drawings of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arcturus has two huge cables, one seven miles long, for hauling in\n",
      "the big trawls. These are put down over the side and held out while the\n",
      "ship goes slowly along at half speed. Sometimes the cable goes out as\n",
      "much as three miles and often the sea is over a mile deep below us.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are thirty-eight in the crew and eighteen members of the\n",
      "expedition. Each night and morning the nets are put over, for a surface\n",
      "haul and for a deep one a sounding is taken—a curious lead on a wire,\n",
      "weighted down with an iron weight which forces the sound lead down to\n",
      "the sea bottom and brings up a sample of the bottom, so we can see if\n",
      "it is muddy or rocky or sandy. Each time the weight automatically drops\n",
      "off when the bottom is reached, because the sounding wire isn’t strong\n",
      "enough to pull it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the nets are out for an hour they are hauled in and the contents\n",
      "put into tubs of water. Sometimes the whole net has only a pint glass\n",
      "full of tiny, tiny fish which have been brought up from a depth of over\n",
      "a mile or two miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the boat my room mate was Dr. W. K. Gregory of the American Museum\n",
      "of Natural History, who is also Professor of Comparative Anatomy at\n",
      "Columbia. Pretty nice, I think, for a real professor to let a\n",
      "twelve-year-old boy bunk with him! Everyone called him just “Greg” and\n",
      "liked him a lot because he always is so nice and so interested in his\n",

      "bottles in which to put insects, a canteen of fresh water, a helmet to\n",
      "keep the heat of the sun from my head (and in the tropics this is very\n",
      "important, especially to protect the back of the neck from the sun).\n",
      "Also I like to have a gig or spear with which I can get some of the\n",
      "kinds of fish which do not bite at bait.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main idea is to get birds’ eggs. Gulls’ nests are mostly on the\n",
      "rocks of the cliffs, doves build on the lava rock on the ground or in\n",
      "little crevasses, mocking birds in low bushes or the cactus trees or\n",
      "shrubs, and the big boobies and frigate birds make ugly twig nests\n",
      "about two or three feet from the ground, the greater number of them\n",
      "nearer the shore, although I did see some on my way up to the crater\n",
      "lake that Dwight had discovered in the center of the island, and these\n",
      "were in higher trees. There was one big nest right on the lava rock\n",
      "under a tree. It was a green heron’s nest and the three half grown\n",
      "birds walked out of the nest when I came near.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day I speared two crawfish in a pool right near shore, but the\n",
      "prongs of the gig were too short to hold them and they got free and\n",
      "darted away. I lost a moray, or poisonous eel the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we swim at the beaches or in the ocean pools near the shore we\n",
      "have to watch out for sharks, sting rays and morays.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day at Tower Island, I went to climb the cliff for birds’ eggs. I\n",
      "took two boxes of soft cotton for packing any eggs I might find. And as\n",
      "I went along I tapped the ground to make the small birds fly up from\n",
      "their nests. This way I could locate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a mocking bird’s nest, took one egg, got some frigate eggs and\n",
      "a gull’s egg. Then I turned to come back and I could not remember the\n",
      "way. So I made for the cliff and the sea and came along till I found a\n",
      "place to climb down again over the huge boulders of loose lava rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frigate nests were near the shore. Their eggs are about the size of\n",
      "a hen’s egg, quite white. The Galápagos gulls’ eggs are smaller. And\n",
      "the boobies’ eggs are like the frigates’ only a little smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "After hunting for birds’ eggs I thought I would go over to see what Lin\n",
      "was doing in the big shallow pools across the beach. She was fishing\n",
      "with a tiny hook and line. So I tried, too, and I caught a lovely\n",
      "little blue and silvery fish about four inches long. It had small white\n",
      "speckles and was a new species. There are many different kinds of fish\n",
      "in these little pools, whole schools of them, varying from one to\n",
      "eighteen inches long and some with very lovely colors, many having\n",
      "stripes of gold and silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later I speared a whole collecting bag full of crabs for Mother to use\n",
      "as bait for her fishing out in the inlet. The black lava rocks are just\n",
      "full of bright colored crabs crawling around ... thousands of small\n",
      "black ones, speckled, and lighter color sandy ones, and great big\n",
      "bright red ones. Evidently they are all chasing each other all the\n",
      "time, and acting like cannibals. And then the rest of the time the\n",
      "birds are swooping down and snatching one. They certainly scurry the\n",

      "\n",
      "This tall helmet is made of thick brass with a triangle shaped glass\n",
      "window in the front. It fits on the shoulders and there is an air space\n",
      "inside so one can breathe. Then fresh air is pumped in by a hand pump,\n",

      "especially in the ears. They buzz and hurt as though someone was\n",

      "equalize the pressure, the same as going down in a high elevator.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is air in front of your eyes so you can see just as perfectly as\n",

      "silvery or striped ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day as Uncle Will entered the water, and was just going down, a\n",
      "huge shark swam by. He waited a few minutes and then went down, and the\n",
      "shark had apparently gone along on his business. Later he had a cage\n",
      "built, so he could stay in that and look around if there were too many\n",
      "sharks.\n",

      "That afternoon when he went down he saw many very strange fish, some\n",
      "bright orange and black with a white cross like a belt, others dark\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course there is always a chance in these waters to see octopus, big\n",

      "\n",
      "One day I went down. I was a little scared because the helmet weighs\n",
      "forty pounds or more and the stuffy feeling of having something over\n",
      "one’s head is unpleasant. I went over the stern of a rowboat in about\n",
      "fifteen feet of water near shore, and climbed down a heavy iron ladder,\n",
      "holding onto the rounds. There is a kind of roar from the air coming\n",
      "in, and a curious feeling against the ears, but otherwise it is grand\n",

      "fish swimming past.\n",

      "southerly of all the islands. It is low-lying with two or three rather\n",
      "higher hills and at the south end an albatross rookery which shows way\n",
      "out at sea, a high rocky headland, with the birds showing white against\n",

      "\n",
      "Compared to the other islands there is little known about Hood. There\n",
      "are lots of sea lions on the beaches and in the coves around the rocks.\n",
      "You may get almost close enough to touch them. Isabel Cooper, who is\n",
      "not afraid of anything, crept near enough to pat one old bull on the\n",
      "flipper. When she laughed aloud he gave a curious grunt and slid into\n",
      "the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "We noticed that several of the sea lions had eye disease, many of the\n",
      "little pups being entirely blind, and the older ones having perhaps one\n",
      "eye dimmed with a white film. So Bill Merriam shot one of them, brought\n",
      "it to the boat, and the doctor took the eyes out to study the sickness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went ashore with the crew one day, and we got a huge log which was\n",
      "covered with barnacles. We pushed it back into the water again and\n",
      "played with it, diving and climbing over it and fooling with it as we\n",
      "would a raft at home. The water is beautifully clear, the white sand\n",
      "and the black rocks showing up perfectly clearly for many feet deep. Of\n",
      "course we were all terribly scratched with rough housing, but it was\n",
      "good fun and fine exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lifted up some of the black rocks along the beach at low tide and\n",
      "found a small octopus. Someone took him out of the jar I had put him\n",
      "into to look at him and left him in the sun, so he died. But he was\n",
      "valuable as a specimen on the ship and has been put with the other jars\n",

      "when it comes to see who it is, John hits him on the back a light tap\n",

      "\n",
      "The fish seem to get quite crazy with the light and they dart around\n",

      "\n",
      "Soon after they saw a great long fin moving slowly along and when they\n",
      "came near found a big flat fish like a skate, slowly skimming just\n",

      "Next morning Don and Dwight and Doc went out to find one with two\n",

      "soon saw a big ripple on the water, a ray going along with his fins\n",
      "sticking up in the air twenty inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "They struck with their harpoons and after a great splash the big ray\n",
      "just sank out of sight and pulled the rope and two kegs right down with\n",
      "him. They waited a long time and watched for him to rise, but when we\n",
      "came along in the launch Pawnee we said we would stay to look while\n",
      "they went to the ship for another harpooning outfit. We chased another\n",
      "big ray for almost half a mile before the others came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dwight took first shot, but the harpoon soon pulled out, and the big\n",
      "fish went sailing along the surface again. Then Don took a shot which\n",
      "held and he played out the rope, holding on to the end so that the ray\n",
      "had to tow the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Bill had come along in another skiff to see the excitement.\n",
      "Bill gave them a second harpoon which Dwight stuck in and then the fish\n",

      "\n",
      "Gradually it swam back towards the ship and the men started their\n",

      "to the boat to get the movie camera for Shorty, and I brought Dwight’s\n",
      "revolver to him. He shot it five times with a thirty-eight, and Bill\n",
      "put in five loads of heavy buck shot. Then it seemed to make a great\n",
      "effort and tried to swim down deep. Don held it with all his strength\n",
      "and would not let it go straight down. It flipped its wing and hit Don\n",
      "right across the shoulder and head twice but he never let go. Then it\n",
      "tried to spill over the boat by getting right under it. But finally\n",
      "they towed it near enough for the sailors to throw a rope down and get\n",
      "a line over it.\n",
      "\n",

      "It measured eighteen feet across from wing to wing and weighed 2400\n",

      "along closer we could easily see it was a great field of hot lava which\n",
      "had reached the sea and was pouring into the cold water. For a while\n",
      "before we reached there we could see a streak of dull green in the\n",
      "water, quite distinct from the dark indigo blue, making a very clear\n",
      "line between the two. And the temperature of the water went up from the\n",
      "normal 74 degrees which we had had right along, to 99 degrees, and even\n",
      "that was a quarter of a mile away from the shore.\n",

      "Luckily, the strong on-shore wind made it possible for us to go very\n",

      "\n",
      "The shore rocks were black, there were two colors in the water, green\n",
      "close to shore and blue out beyond, and these big masses of very white\n",
      "steamy smoke. And then as we came closer we could see huge openings at\n",
      "the end of the lava flow, like pipes emptying red hot lava out into the\n",
      "water. It looked like bright blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "All day till dark, we circled around and kept passing near it, keeping\n",
      "about a quarter of a mile from shore. There were high waves and a\n",
      "strong breeze and the smoke was blowing steadily up the mountain side\n",
      "so that by sunset time we couldn’t see the little cones up on the\n",
      "higher slopes from which the whole flow had come down.\n",

      "which glowed red in the dark and little specks of hot fiery places all\n",
      "along the slopes. And then at the bottom right at the shore, these\n",
      "great huge open hot red streams spilling out into the sea. Once or\n",
      "twice it would break out in bigger flows or whole big chunks would fall\n",
      "off into the water, and then it would shoot out and throw boiling lava\n",
      "into the air, way up, like blasting or skyrockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the glasses we could see several birds which had flown too near\n",
      "and their bodies were floating along in the water. Once we saw a poor\n",

      "flop down dead right near the terrible stream. A great big octopus\n",
      "floated by, just about dead. And we watched a whole wave so full of\n",
      "fish it looked black, swimming as fast as they possibly could straight\n",
      "out to the cold water. Once too, we saw a shark in a kind of daze,\n",
